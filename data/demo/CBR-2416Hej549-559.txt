Abstract. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for transformational
adaptation based on detecting a solution’s incompatibility regarding the new
problem situation and trying to overcome the incompatibility in an iterative
manner. By incompatibility, we mean a state for which the required objectives
are not satisfied due to any change in the status of the constraints. Based upon
this approach, we have proposed a framework for redesigning an existing
system under new constraints. To show the capability of this framework, a
software prototype was developed that it is capable of redesigning an existing
digital circuit under presence of new constraints, e.g. type of gates, power
dissipation, fan in/out, gate prices and so on.
