ABSTRACT
This paper presents a study of an auditory version of the game   
Towers of Hanoi. In this study, we have compared three           
different strategies for continuous presentation of the objects.                         
The focus for this study is to investigate the nature of auditory                        
direct manipulation, where continuous presentation is one of                             
the key aspects. The results show that the differences between                           
the strategies need to be explored further by experimentation.                           
Additionally, much effort has to be put on the learning phase                            
of the auditory interface and the mouse interaction has to be                            
investigated further.
