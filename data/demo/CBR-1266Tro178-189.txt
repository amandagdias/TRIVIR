Abstract
Troubleshooting is a common application of case base technology. Often in these cases, the
goal is to capture the approaches of troubleshooting experts and put these troubleshooting best
practices in the hands of lesser experienced analysts. Effective knowledge capture is the
primary bottleneck to creating a good troubleshooting case base. We used the KADS
knowledge modeling methodology to guide the knowledge acquisition to create such a case
base. KADS helped us to validate the logic of the entire case base before writing one case and
to implement it more quickly than normal and with no errors. This paper illustrates our
experience in the use of KADS to help build case bases effectively.
