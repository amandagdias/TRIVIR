ABSTRACT
Much work in information retrieval focuses on using a model
of documents and queries to derive retrieval algorithms. Model
based development is a useful alternative to heuristic devel≠opment 
because in a model the assumptions are explicit and
can be examined and refined independent of the particular
retrieval algorithm. We explore the explicit assumptions un≠derlying 
the naòêve Bayesian framework by performing com≠putational 
analysis of actual corpora and queries to devise a
generative document model that closely matches text. Our
thesis is that a model so developed will be more accurate
than existing models, and thus more useful in retrieval, as
well as other applications. We test this by learning from a
corpus the best document model. We find the learned model
better predicts the existence of text data and has improved
performance on certain IR tasks.
