Abstract. Cross­language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries
and documents are in different languages, needs a translation of queries
and/or documents, so as to standardize both of them into a common
representation. For this purpose, the use of machine translation is an
effective approach. However, computational cost is prohibitive in trans­lating 
large­scale document collections. To resolve this problem, we pro­
pose a two­stage CLIR method. First, we translate a given query into the
document language, and retrieve a limited number of foreign documents.
Second, we machine translate only those documents into the user lan­guage, 
and re­rank them based on the translation result. We also show
the effectiveness of our method by way of experiments using Japanese
queries and English technical documents.
