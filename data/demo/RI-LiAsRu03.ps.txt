Abstract
This paper discusses several distributed power­
aware routing protocols in wireless ad­hoc networks
(especially sensor networks). We seek to optimize the
lifetime of the network. We have developed three dis­tributed 
power­aware algorithms and analyzed their ef­ficiency 
in terms of the number of message broadcasts
and the overall network lifetime modeled as the time
to the first message that can not be sent. These are:
(1) a distributed min Power algorithm (modeled on a
distributed version of Dijkstra's algorithm), (2) a dis­tributed 
max­min algorithm, and (3) the distributed ver­sion of 
our the centralized online max­min zPmin al­gorithm 
presented in [12]. The first two algorithms are
used to define the third, although they are very inter­esting 
and useful on their own for applications where
the optimization criterion is the minimum power, re­spectively 
the maximum residual power. The distributed
max­min zPmin algorithm optimizes the overall life­-time 
of the network by avoiding nodes of low power,
while not using too much total power.
