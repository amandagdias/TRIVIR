Abstract. This paper presents a policy to retain new cases based on
retrieval benefits for case-based planning (CBP). After each case-based
problem solving episode, an analysis of the adaptation effort is made to
evaluate the guidance provided by the retrieved cases. If the guidance is
determined to be detrimental, the obtained solution is retain as a new
case in the case base. Otherwise, if the retrieval is beneficial, the case base
remains unchanged. We will observe that the notion of adaptable cases is
not adequate to address the competence of a case base in the context of
CBP. Instead, we claim that the notion of detrimental retrieval is more
adequate. We compare our retain policy against two policies in the CBP
literature and claim that our policy to retain cases based on the benefits
is more effective. Our claim is supported by empirical validation.
