Separating the Power of Monotone Span Programs
over Different Fields

Amos Beimel  Enav Weinreb y

Abstract
Monotone span programs are a linear­algebraic model
of computation. They are equivalent to linear secret shar­ing 
schemes and have various applications in cryptogra­phy 
and complexity. A fundamental question is how the
choice of the field in which the algebraic operations are
performed effects the power of the span program. In this
paper we prove that the power of monotone span programs
over finite fields of different characteristics is incompara­ble; 
we show a super­polynomial separation between any
two fields with different characteristics, answering an open
problem of Pudl’ ak and Sgall 1998. Using this result we
prove a super­polynomial lower bound for monotone span
programs for a function in uniform NC 2 (and therefore
in P), answering an open problem of Babai, Wigderson,
and G’ al 1999. (All previous lower bounds for monotone
span programs were for functions not known to be in P.) Fi­nally, 
we show that quasi­linear schemes, a generalization
of linear secret sharing schemes introduced in Beimel and
Ishai 2001, are stronger than linear secret sharing schemes.
In particular, this proves, without any assumptions, that
non­linear secret sharing schemes are more efficient than
linear secret sharing schemes.
