Abstract
In this thesis, we have designed and implemented a system for performing structural
searched in Haystack. The Haystack data model is semi­structured, and the chal­
lenge of this project was to develop a system that performs database­like queries on
semistructured data using current relational database technologies. To achieve this
goal, we have designed a database schema that would allow us to store our data
model. We have specified the format in which the user can enter database queries
and implemented procedures that translate user queries into SQL. We have designed
a way to integrate structural search with text search in Haystack and have outlined
ideas on how database queries can be used for machine learning.
