Abstract. A major knowledge­engineering bottleneck for information
extraction systems is the process of constructing an appropriate dictio­nary 
of extraction patterns. AutoSlog is a dictionary construction system
that has been shown to substantially reduce the time required for knowl­edge 
engineering by learning extraction patterns automatically. However,
an open question was whether these extraction patterns were useful for
tasks other than information extraction. We describe a series of experi­ments 
that show how the extraction patterns learned by AutoSlog can be
used for text classification. Three dictionaries produced by AutoSlog for
different domains performed well in our text classification experiments.
