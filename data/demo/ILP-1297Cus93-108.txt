Abstract. A system for ‘tagging’ words with their part-of-speech (POS)
tags is constructed. The system has two components: a lexicon containing 
the set of possible POS tags for a given word, and rules which use
a word’s context to eliminate possible tags for a word. The Inductive
Logic Programming (ILP) system Progol is used to induce these rules
in the form of definite clauses. The final theory contained 885 clauses.
For background knowledge, Progol uses a simple grammar, where the
tags are terminals and predicates such as nounp (noun phrase) are non-terminais. 
Progol was altered to allow the caching of information about
clauses generated during the induction process which greatly increased
efficiency. The system achieved a per-word accuracy of 96.4% on known
words drawn from sentences without quotation marks. This is on a par
with other tagging systems induced from the same data [5, 2, 4] which
all have accuracies in the range 96—97%. The per-sentence accuracy was
49.5%.
