Abstract. We propose to analyze CBR systems at knowledge level following the
Components of Expertise methodology. This methodology has been used for
design and construction of KBS applications. We have applied it to analyze
learning methods of existing systems at knowledge level. As example we
develop the knowledge level analysis of CHEF. Then a common task structure
of CBR systems is explained. We claim that this sort of analysis can be a first
step to integrate different learning methods into case-based reasoning systems.
