Abstract:	We present a framework for assessing knowledge management 
(KM) technology that has been validated by using more than
twenty well-known tools. Based on a commercial case-based reasoning
(CBR) tool, the technology descriptions have been made available in
the KM-PEB experience base over the World Wide Web. KM researchers 
as well as KM tool developers and/or users can search for similar
descriptions and/or contribute their own ones. We think that the KM
and CBR communities can benefit very much from each other, and we
hope that this paper - and its underlying application KM-PEB - supports
the (already started) collaboration of these communities in a constructive way.
