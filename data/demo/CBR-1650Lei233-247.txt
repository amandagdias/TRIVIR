Abstract. The case-based reasoning paradigm is applied in support of decision
making processes related to pile foundations. Based on this paradigm, the
system accumulates experience from previously realized pile foundations. This
experience can be drawn when new situations with similar attributes of
geotechnical situation of the site and geometric characteristics of the piles are
encountered. Two case libraries were created based on previously realized sites.
The representativeness of the case libraries and the efficiency of the search
process are facilitated by the use of a genetic algorithm reduction.
