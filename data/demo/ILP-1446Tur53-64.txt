Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has been applied to discover 
rules governing the three-dimensional topology of protein structure.
The data-set unifies two sources of information; SCOP and PROMOTIF.
Cross-validation results for experiments using two background knowledge 
sets, global (attribute-valued) and constitutional (relational), are
presented. The application makes use of a new feature of Progol4.4 for
numeric parameter estimation. At this early stage of development, the
rules produced can only be applied to proteins for which the secondary
structure is known. However, since the rules are insightful, they should
prove to be helpful in assisting the development of taxonomic schemes.
The application of ILP to fold recognition represents a novel and promising 
approach to this problem.
