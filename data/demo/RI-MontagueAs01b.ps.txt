ABSTRACT
Given the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple
search engines in response to a given query, the problem of
metasearch is to combine these lists in a way which optimizes
the performance of the combination. This problem can be
naturally decomposed into three subproblems: (1) normaliz­ing 
the relevance scores given by the input systems, (2) es­timating 
relevance scores for unretrieved documents, and
(3) combining the newly­acquired scores for each document into one, improved score.
Research on the problem of metasearch has historically concentrated 
on algorithms for combining (normalized) scores.
In this paper, we show that the techniques used for normal­izing 
relevance scores and estimating the relevance scores of
unretrieved documents can have a significant effect on the
overall performance of metasearch. We propose two new
normalization/estimation techniques and demonstrate em­pirically 
that the performance of well known metasearch al­gorithms 
can be significantly improved through their use.
