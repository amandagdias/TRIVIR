Abstract
Software project effort estimation is a difficult problem complicated by a variety of
interrelated factors. Current regression-based models have not had much success in
accurately estimating system size. This paper describes a case based reasoning approach to
software estimation which performs somewhat better than regression models based on the
same data and which has some similarity to human expert judgement approaches. An
analysis is performed to determine whether different forms of averaging and adaptation
improve the overall quality of the estimate.
