Abstract. We present a case adaptation method that employs ideas from the field of
genetic algorithms. Two types of adaptations, case combination and case mutation, are
used to evolve variations on the contents of retrieved cases until a satisfactory solution is
found for a new specified problem. A solution is satisfactory if it matches the specitied
requirements and does not violate any constraints imposed by the domain of
applicability. We have implemented our ideas in a computational system called
GENCAD, applied to the layout design of residences such that they conform to the
principles of feng shui, the Chinese art of placement. This implementation allows us to
evaluate the use of GA’s for case adaptation in CBR. Experimental results show the role
of representation and constraints.
