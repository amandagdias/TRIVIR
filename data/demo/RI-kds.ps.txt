Abstract
A (g; b) key distribution scheme allows conferences of g users to generate secret keys,
such that disjoint coalitions of b users cannot gain any information on the generated
key (in the information theoretic sense). In this work, we study the relationships
between communication and space efficiency of key distribution schemes. We prove
that communication does not help in the context of unrestricted schemes. On the
other hand, we show that for restricted schemes, which are secure only when used by
a limited number of conferences, communication can substantially improve the space
efficiency. We also present lower bounds on the space efficiency of restricted schemes.
Index Terms -- Key Distribution, communicating protocols, space efficiency, one
time schemes, cryptography.
