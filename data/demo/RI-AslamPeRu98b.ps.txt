Abstract
In this paper we present a system for static and dy­
namic information organization and show our evaluations
of this system on TREC data. We introduce the off­line
and on­line star clustering algorithms for information or­
ganization. Our evaluation experiments show that the offline 
star algorithm outperforms the single link and average
link clustering algorithms. Since the star algorithm is also
highly e#cient and simple to implement, we advocate its
use for tasks that require clustering, such as information
organization, browsing, filtering, routing, topic tracking,
and new topic detection.
