Abstract: This report describes our tests on applying statistical translation models for bilingual IR
tasks in CLEF­2001. These translation models have been trained on a set of parallel web pages
automatically mined from the Web. Our previous studies have shown the utility of such corpora for
cross­language information retrieval. The goal of the current tests is to see how we can improve the
quality of the translation models and make best uses of them. Several questions are considered: Is
it useful to consider the IDF factor in addition to the translation probabilities? Is it useful to further
clean the training corpora before model training or the translation models themselves? How could
we combine the translation models with bilingual dictionaries? Although our test do not allow us to
answer all these questions, they provide useful indication to several further research directions.
