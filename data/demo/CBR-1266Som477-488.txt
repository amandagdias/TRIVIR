Abstract. Case-based reasoning (CBR) can be used as a form of “caching”
solved problems to speedup later problem solving. Using “cached” cases
brings additional costs with it due to retrieval time, case adaptation time
and also storage space. Simply storing all cases will result in a situation
in which retrieving and trying to adapt old cases will take more time
(on average) than not caching at all. This means that caching must be
applied selectively to build a case memory that is actually useful. This is
a form of the utility problem [4, 2]. The approach taken here is to construct 
a “cost model” of a system that can be used to predict the effect
of changes to the system. In this paper we describe the utility problem
associated with “caching” cases and the construction of a “cost model”.
We present experimental results that demonstrate that the model can
be used to predict the effect of certain changes to the case memory.
