Abstract
The Haystack project seeks to design and implement a distributed, intelligent, per­sonalized, 
information retrieval system. Haystack archives documents with meta­
data, which is also indexed by the system to improve query results. To support
this system, an infrastructure needed to be designed and implemented. This thesis
covers the overall design of that infrastructure with a focus on the service model,
event model, remote communications model, and necessary services for the addition
of our core metadata for documents in the system.
