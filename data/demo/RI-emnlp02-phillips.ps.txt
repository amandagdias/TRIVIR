Abstract
We present a bootstrapping method that
uses strong syntactic heuristics to learn
semantic lexicons. The three sources
of information are appositives, compound
nouns, and ISA clauses. We apply heuris­
tics to these syntactic structures, embed
them in a bootstrapping architecture, and
combine them with co­training. Results
on WSJ articles and a pharmaceutical cor­pus 
show that this method obtains high
precision and finds a large number of
terms.
