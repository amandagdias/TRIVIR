Abstract. A novel first order clustering system, called C 0.5, is presented. 
It inherits its logical decision tree formalism from the TILDE
system, but instead of using class information to guide the search, it
employs the principles of instance based learning in order to perform
clustering. Various experiments are discussed, which show the promise
of the approach.
