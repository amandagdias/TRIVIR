Abstract.                                                    
The views of some artists on what constitutes life are explored, with the aim of
challenging those within the artificial life research community to rethink and
perhaps expand their own views about the term and its meaningful application. The
focus is on the musical works of  Steve Reich and the paintings of Wassily
Kandinsky. The role of the observer in determining when it is appropriate to label a
hing as living is also discussed.
