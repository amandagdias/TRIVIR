Abstract. The particular strength of CBR is normally considered to be its use in
weak theory domains where solution quality is compiled into cases and is
reusable. In this paper we explore an alternative use of CBR in optimisation
problems where cases represent highly optimised structures in a huge highly
constrained solution space. Our analysis focuses on the Travelling Salesman
Problem where difficulty arises from the computational complexity of the
problem rather than any difficulty associated with the domain theory. We find
that CBR is good for producing medium quality solutions in very quick time. We
have difficulty getting CBR to produce high quality solutions because solution
quality seems to be lost in the adaptation process. We also argue that experiments
with CBR on transparent problems such as the TSP tell us a lot about aspects of
CBR such as; the quality of CBR solutions, the coverage that cases in the case-base 
offer and the utility of extending a case-base.
