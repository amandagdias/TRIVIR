An Empirical Study of Automated Dictionary
Construction for Information Extraction in Three
Domains

A primary goal of natural language processing researchers is to de­
velop a knowledge­based natural language processing (NLP) system
that is portable across domains. However, most knowledge-­based
NLP systems rely on a domain­specific dictionary of concepts,
which represents a substantial knowledge­engineering bottleneck.
We have developed a system called AutoSlog that addresses the
knowledge­engineering bottleneck for a task called information ex­traction. 
AutoSlog automatically creates domain­specific dictionar­
ies for information extraction, given an appropriate training corpus.
We have used AutoSlog to create a dictionary of extraction patterns
for terrorism, which achieved 98% of the performance of a hand­
crafted dictionary that required approximately 1500 person­hours
to build. In this paper, we describe experiments with AutoSlog in
two additional domains: joint ventures and microelectronics. We
compare the performance of AutoSlog across the three domains,
discuss the lessons learned about the generality of this approach,
and present results from two experiments which demonstrate that
novice users can generate effective dictionaries using AutoSlog.
