Abstract. Our recipe planner for bioprocesses, Sophist, uses a semi-qualitative
model to reason about cases. The model represents qualitative knowledge about
the possible effects of differences between cases and about the possible causes
of observed problems. Hence, the model is a crucial resource of adaptation
knowledge. The model representation has been developed specifically to
support CBR tasks. The essential notion in this representation is that of an
influence. Representation of domain knowledge in an influence graph and a
mapping of case-features onto nodes of such a graph, enable a variety of
interesting reasoning tasks. Examples of such task illustrate how qualitative
reasoning and case-based reasoning support each other in complex planning
tasks.
