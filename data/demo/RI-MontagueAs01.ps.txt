ABSTRACT
We investigate the performance of metasearch algorithms
in terms of how much they improve consistency. We find
that three di#erent metasearch algorithms, each over three
datasets, usually improve the consistency of search results;
sometimes the improvement is dramatic. Furthermore, con­sistency 
tends to improve when performance improves.
