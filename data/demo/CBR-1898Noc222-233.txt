Abstract. In this paper, we propose a thorough investigation of a nearest 
neighbor rule wbich we call the “Symmetric Nearest Neighbor (sNN)
rule”. Basically, it symmetrises the classical nearest neighbor relationship
from which are computed the points voting for some instance. Experiments 
on 29 datasets, most of which are readily available, show that
thc method significantly outperforms the traditional Nearest Neighbors
methods. Experiments on a domain of interest related to tropical pollution 
normalization also show the greater potential of this method. We
finally discuss the reasons for the mule’s efficiency, provide methods for
speeding-up the classification time, and derive from the sNN rule a reliable 
and fast algorithm to fix the parameter k in the k-NN rule, a
longstanding problem in this field.
