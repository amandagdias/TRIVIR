Abstract. This paper reports about a project on document retrieval in
an industrial setting. The objective is to provide a tool that helps finding
documents related to a given query, such as answers in Frequently Asked
Questions databases. A CBR approach has been used to develop a run-
ning prototypical system which is currently under practical evaluation.
