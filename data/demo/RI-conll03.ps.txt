Abstract
We explore the idea of creating a subjectiv­ity 
classifier that uses lists of subjective nouns
learned by bootstrapping algorithms. The goal
of our research is to develop a system that
can distinguish subjective sentences from ob­jective 
sentences. First, we use two bootstrap­ping 
algorithms that exploit extraction patterns
to learn sets of subjective nouns. Then we
train a Naive Bayes classifier using the subjec­tive 
nouns, discourse features, and subjectivity
clues identified in prior research. The boot­strapping 
algorithms learned over 1000 subjec­tive 
nouns, and the subjectivity classifier per­formed 
well, achieving 77% recall with 81%
precision.
