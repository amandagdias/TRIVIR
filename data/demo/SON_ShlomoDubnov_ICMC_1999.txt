Abstract                             
In this paper we presen ta statistical learning algorithm for synthesizing
new random instances of a sound texture given an example of such a texture       
as input. A large class of natural and artificial sounds such as rain, waterfall, 
traffic noises, people babble, machine noises, etc., can be regarded as sound     
textures—sound signals that are approximately stationary at some scale. 
Treating the input sound texture as a sample of a stochastic process, we  
construct a tree representing a hierarchical wavelet transform of the signal. 
From this tree, new randomtrees are generatedby learningand sampling      
the conditional probabilities of the paths in the original tree. Transformation 
of these random trees back into signals results in new sound textures  
that closely resemble the sonic impression of the original sound source but   
without exactly repeating it. Applications of this method are abundant and     
include, for example, automatic generation of sound effects, creative musical 
and sonic manipulations, and virtual reality sonification. Examples are  
visually demonstrated in the paper and acoustically demonstrated in an accompanying 
website.
