ABSTRACT
Most of the current tools for working with sound work on sin­gle 
soundfiles, use 2D graphics and offer limited interaction to the
user. In this paper we describe a set of tools for working with col­lections 
of sounds that are based on interactive 3D graphics. These
tools form two families: sound analysis visualization displays and
model­based controllers for sound synthesis algorithms.
We describe the general techniques we have used to develop
these tools and give specific case studies from each family. Several
collections of sounds were used for development and evaluation.
These are: a set of musical instrument tones, a set of sound effects,
a set of FM radio audio clips belonging to several music genres,
and a set of mp3 rock song snippets.
