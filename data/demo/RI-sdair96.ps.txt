Abstract
We show that two simple constraints, when
applied to short user queries (on the order of
5--10 words) can yield precision scores com­parable 
to or better than those achieved using
long queries (50--85 words) at low document
cutoff levels. These constraints are meant to
detect documents that have subtopic passages
that includes the most important components
of the query. The constraints are: (i) a sim­ple 
Boolean constraint which requires the user
to specify the query as a list of topics; this
list is converted into a conjunct of disjuncts
by the system, and (ii) a subtopic­sized prox­imity 
constraint imposed over the Boolean con­straint. 
The vector space model is used to rank
the documents that satisfy both constraints. Ex­periments 
run over 45 TREC queries show sig­nificant, 
almost consistent improvements over
rankings that use no constraints. These results
have important ramifications for interactive sys­tems 
intended for casual users, such as those
searching on the World Wide Web.
