Abstract. The paper presents results of using FOIDL, an inductive logic
programming system, to learn the inflectional paradigms of Slovene nouns.
FOIDL learns first-order decision lists, defined as ordered list of clauses; it
has been previously tested on the problem of inducing rules for forming
the past tense of English verbs. Slovene, unlike English, has rich inflectional 
morphology, and the paper reports the result of applying FOIDL
over a large lexicon of Slovene word-forms to induce rules for the synthesis 
and analysis of the full inflectional paradigms of Slovene nouns.
