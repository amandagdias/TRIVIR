ABSTRACT 
A model for physically based synthesis of collision sounds
is proposed. Attention is focused on the non-linear contact
force, for which both analytical and experimental results are
presented. Numerical implementation of the model is discussed, 
with regard to accuracy and efﬁciency issues. As an
application, a physically based audio effect is presented.
