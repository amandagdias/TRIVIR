Abstract. CaseMaker is an interactive environment for intelligent case-authoring 
support in CREST, a ease-based reasoner for estimation tasks, in
which the selection of cases for addition to a case library is guided by
empirical evaluation of the coverage contributions of candidate eases. We
present a new version of the environment called CaseMaker-2 which is
designed to support ease authoring more effectively by eliminating a
previous requirement for the evaluation of candidate eases to be repeated
following the addition of a new ease to the library. A key role in the
approach is played by eValuate, an algorithm for dynamic partitioning of
the space of uncovered eases in such a way that the partition containing a
given ease represents the minimum additional coverage provided by its
addition to the ease library.
