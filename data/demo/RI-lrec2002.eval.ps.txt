Abstract
An important aspect of word sense disambiguation is the evaluation of different methods and parameters. Unfortunately, there is a lack
of test sets for evaluation, specifically for languages other than English and even more so for specific domains like medicine. Given
that our work focuses on English as well as German text in the medical domain, we had to develop our own evaluation corpora in
order to test our disambiguation methods. In this paper we describe the work on developing these corpora, using GermaNet and UMLS
as (lexical) semantic resources, next to a description of the annotation tool KiC that we developed for support of the annotation task.
