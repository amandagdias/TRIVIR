In this paper, we present a formal theory of a behavioral L-system and describe as application a real
time structured L-system interpreter. The behavioral L-system is a timed, conditional, stochastic,
parametric and environmentally sensitive L-system which allows besides the modeling of plant and
fractal development the description and animation of autonomous actors completely defined by
production rules. Virtual environment including geometric objects, force fields and sounds and the
behaviors of actors can be defined using the same formalism of the behavioral L-systems.
