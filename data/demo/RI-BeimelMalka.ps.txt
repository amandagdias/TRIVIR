ABSTRACT
Reliable communication between parties in a network is a basic
requirement for executing any protocol. Dolev [4] and Dolev et
al. [5] showed that reliable communication is possible if and only
if the communication network is sufficiently connected. Beimel
and Franklin [1] showed that the connectivity requirement can be
relaxed if some pairs of parties share authentication keys. That is,
costly communication links can be replaced by authentication keys.
In this work, we continue this line of research. We consider the
scenario where there is a specific sender and a specific receiver.
In this case, the protocol of [1] has n O(n) rounds even if there is
a single Byzantine processor. We present a more efficient proto­col 
with round complexity of (n=t) O(t) , where n is the number of
processors in the network and t is an upper bound on the number
of Byzantine processors in the network. Specifically, our protocol
is polynomial when the number of Byzantine processors is O(1),
and for every t its round complexity is bounded by 2 O(n) . The
same improvements hold for reliable and private communication.
The improved protocol is obtained by analyzing the properties of a
``communication and authentication graph'' that characterizes reliable 
communication.
