Abstract. VS-CBR [14] is a simple instance-based learning algorithm
that adjusts a weighted similarity measure as well as collecting cases.
This paper presents a ‘PAC’ analysis of VS-CBR, motivated by the
PAC learning framework, which demonstrates two main ideas relevant
to the study of instance-based learners. Firstly, the hypothesis spaces of
a learner on different target concepts can be compared to predict the
difficulty of the target concepts for the learner. Secondly, it is helpful to
consider the ‘constituent parts’ of an instance-based learner: to explore
separately how many examples are needed to infer a good similarity
measure and how many examples are needed for the case base. Applying
these approaches, we show that VS-CBR learns quickly if most of the
variables in the representation are irrelevant to the target concept and
more slowly if there are more relevant variables. The paper relates this
overall behaviour to the behaviour of the constituent parts of VS-CBR.
