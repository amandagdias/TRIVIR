Abstract. Most applications of inductive logic programming focus on
prediction or the discovery of new knowledge. We describe a less common
application of ILP namely verification and validation of knowledge based
systems and multi-agent systems. Using inductive logic programming,
partial declarative specifications of the software can be induced from the
behaviour of the software. These rules can be readily interpreted by the
designers or users of the software, and can in turn result in changes to the
software. The approach outlined was tested in the domain of multi-agent
systems, more in particular the RoboCup domain.
