Abstract. Relational reinforcement learning is presented, a learning
technique that combines reinforcement learning with relational learning 
or inductive logic programming. Due to the use of a more expressive
representation language to represent states, actions and Q-functions, relational 
reinforcement learning can be potentially applied to a new range
of learning tasks. One such task that we investigate is planning in the
block’s world, where it is assumed that the effects of the actions are unknown 
to the agent and the agent has to learn a policy. Within this simple
domain we show that relational reinforcement learning solves some existing 
problems with reinforcement learning. In particular, relational reinforcement 
learning allows to employ structural representations, to make
abstraction of specific goals pursued and to exploit the results of previous
learning phases when addressing new (more complex) situations.
