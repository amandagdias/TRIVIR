Abstract. This paper describes the integration of analogical reasoning
into general problem solving as a method of learning at the strategy level
to solve problems more effectively. The method hased on derivational
analogy has been fully implemented in PRODIGY/ANALOGY and proven
empirically to he amenable to scaling up hoth in terms of domain and
problem complexity. PRODIGY/ANALOGY addresses a set of challenging
problems, namely: how to accumulate episodic problem solving experience, 
cases, how to define and decide when two problem solving situations
are similar, how to organize a large library of planning cases so that
it may be efficiently retrieved, and finally how to successfully transfer
chains of problem solving decisions from past experience to new problem
solving situations when only a partial match exists among corresponding
problems. The paper discusses the generation and replay of the problem
solving cases and we illustrate the algorithms with examples. We present
briefly the library organization and the retrieval strategy. We relate this
work with other alternative strategy learning methods, and also with
plan reuse. PRODIGY/ANALOGY casts the strategy-level learning process
for the first time as the automation of the complete cycle of constructing, 
storing, retrieving, and flexibly reusing problem solving experience.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the analogical replay strategy by
providing empirical results on the performance of PRODIGY/ANALOGY,
accumulating and reusing a large case library in a complex problem solving 
domain. The integrated learning system reduces the problem solving
search effort incrementally as more episodic experience is compiled into
the library of accumulated learned knowledge.
