Abstract. This paper describes a memory-based planning system. The
memory constitutes a collection of generalized plans, which we call skeletons. 
Each skeleton embodies a style, and organizes planning knowledge
in a packaging hierarchy. Traversal of this hierarchy results in hierarchical 
plan development, and the process is guided by a secondary memory
which organizes the properties of ingredients into an inheritance hierarchy. 
A simple indexing hierarchy allows access to each skeleton, which is
quite distinct and captures a whole class of plans in that style. Stepwise
refinement of the plan is accompanied by modifications which add ingredient 
specific steps on the way. A system has been implemented in the
culinary domain.
