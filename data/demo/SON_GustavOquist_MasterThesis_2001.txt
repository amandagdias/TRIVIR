Abstract 
Can readability on small screens be improved by using Rapid Serial Visual 
Presentation (RSVP) that adapts the presentation speed to characteristics found in 
the text? In this thesis Adaptive RSVP is introduced together with two algorithms for 
adaptation. Findings from a usability evaluation, where the ability to read long and 
short texts on a mobile device in a realistic setting was assessed, are reported. In a 
balanced repeated-measurement experiment employing 16 subjects two variants of 
Adaptive RSVP were benchmarked against Fixed RSVP and traditional text 
presentation. No significant differences were found for reading speed and 
comprehension for long texts but for short texts all RSVP formats increased reading 
speed by 33%. For long texts Adaptive RSVP decreased task load compared to Fixed 
RSVP and repeated use of RSVP, regardless of type, was also found to decrease task 
load. No differences in task load were however found for short texts. Causes, 
implications and effects of these findings are discussed together with directions for 
further work.
