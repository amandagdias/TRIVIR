Abstract. The general aim of the present paper is to show the advantages 
of the model-theoretic approach to Inductive Logic Programming. 
The paper introduces a new generality ordering between Horn
clauses, called A-subsumption. It is stronger than e-subsumption and
weaker than generalized subsumption. Most importantly A-subsumption
allows to compare clauses in a local sense, i.e. with respect to a partial
interpretation. This allows to define a non-trivial upper bound in the 
Asubsumption lattice without the use of negative examples. An algorithm
for concept learning from positive-only examples, based on these ideas,
is described and its performance is empirically evaluated in the paper.
