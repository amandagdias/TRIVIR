Abstract. Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems engage their
users in a series of questions and answers and present them with cases that are
most applicable to their decision problem. In previous research, we introduced
the Taxonomic CCBR methodology, an extension of standard CCBR that
improved performance by organizing features related by abstraction into
taxonomies. We recently extended this methodology to include causal relations
between taxonomies and claimed that it could yield additional performance
gains. In this paper, we formalize the causal extension of Taxonomic CCBR,
called Causal CCBR, and empirically assess its benefits using a new
methodology for evaluating CCBR performance. Evaluation of Taxonomic and
Causal CCBR systems in troubleshooting and customer support domains
demonstrates that they significantly outperform the standard CCBR approach.
In addition, Causal CCBR outperforms Taxonomic CCBR to the extent causal
relations are incorporated in the case bases.
