Abstract. Case-Based Reasoning is a good framework for Software Reuse 
because it provides a flexible and powerful searching mechanism
for software components. In a CBR system for software reuse it is important 
to learn the user preferences adapting the system software
choices to the user. In a complex domain as software design, the similarity 
metric will also be complex, thus creating the necessity for a
learning algorithm capable of weight learning. In this paper we present
an evolutionary approach to similarity weight learning in a CBR system
for software reuse. This approach is justified by the similarity metric
complexity and recursive nature, which makes other learning methods to
fail. We present experimental work showing the feasibility of this approach 
and we also present a parametric study, exploring several crossover 
and mutation strategies.
