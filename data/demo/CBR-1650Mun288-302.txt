Abstract. This paper describes HICAP, a general-purpose, interactive
case-based plan authoring architecture that can be applied to decision
support tasks to yield a hierarchical course of action. It integrates a hierarchical 
task editor with a conversational case-based planner. HICAP
maintains both a task hierarchy representing guidelines that constrain
the final plan and the hierarchical social organization responsible for
these tasks. It also supports bookkeeping, which is crucial for real-world
large-scale planning tasks. By selecting tasks corresponding to the hierarchy’s 
leaf nodes, users can activate the conversational case-based planner
to interactively refine guideline tasks into a concrete plan. Thus, HICAP
can be used to generate context sensitive plans and should be useful for
assisting with planning complex tasks such as noncombatant evacuation
operations. We describe an experiment with a highly detailed military
simulator to investigate this claim. The results show that plans generated
by HICAP were superior to those generated by alternative approaches.
