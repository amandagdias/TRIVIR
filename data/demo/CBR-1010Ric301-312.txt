Abstract. This paper presents a new class of local similarity metrics,
called AASM, that are not symmetric and that can be adopted as the
basic retrieval method in a CBR system. An anytime learning procedure 
is also introduced that, starting from an initial set of stored cases,
improves the retrieval accuracy by modifying the local definition of the
metric. The learning procedure is a reinforcement learning algorithm and
can be run as a black box since no particular setting is required. With
the aid of classical test sets it is shown that AASM can improve in many
cases the accuracy of both nearest neighbour methods and Salzberg’s
NGE. Moreover, AASM can achieve significant data compression (10%)
while maintainig the same accuracy as NN.
