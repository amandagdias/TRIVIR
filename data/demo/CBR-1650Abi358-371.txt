Abstract. In response to the occurrence of an air incident, controllers at one of
the three Canadian Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC) must make a series of
critical decisions on the appropriate procedures to follow. These procedures
(called incident prosecution) include hypotheses formulation and information
gathering, development of a plan for the search and rescue (SAR) missions and
in the end, the generation of reports. We present in this paper the results of a
project aimed at evaluating the applicability of CBR to help support incident
prosecution in the RCC. We have identified three possible applications of CBR:
Online help, real time support for situation assessment, and report generation.
We present a brief description of the situation assessment agent system that we
are implementing as a result of this study.
