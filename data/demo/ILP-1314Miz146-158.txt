Abstract. This paper provides an empirical study of an Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) method through the application to classifying ocular
fundus images for glaucoma diagnosis. Key issues in this study are not
only dealing with low-level measurement data such as image, but also
producing diagnostic rules that are readable and comprehensive for 
interactions to medical experts. For this purpose, we develop a 
constraint-directed ILP system, GKS, that handles both symbolic and numerical
data, and produce Horn clauses with numerical constraints. Furthermore,
we provide GKS with a “sequential” learning facility where GKS 
repeatedly generates a single best rule which becomes background knowledge
for the next learning phase. Since the learning target for this application
is the abnormality of each segment in image, generated rules represent
the relationships between abnormal segments. Since such relationships
can be interpreted as qualitative rules and be used as diagnostic rules 
directly, the present method provides automatic construction of knowledge
base from expert’s accumulated diagnostic experience. Furthermore, the
experimental result shows that induced rules have high statistical 
performance. The present study indicates the advantage and possibility of
the ILP approach to medical diagnosis from measurement data.
