ABSTRACT
We present a unified framework for simultaneously solving
both the pooling problem (the construction of eficient doc­ument 
pools for the evaluation of retrieval systems) and
metasearch (the fusion of ranked lists returned by retrieval
systems in order to increase performance). The implemen­tation 
is based on the Hedge algorithm for online learning,
which has the advantage of convergence to bounded error
rates approaching the performance of the best linear com­bination 
of the underlying systems. The choice of a loss
function closely related to the average precision measure of
system performance ensures that the judged document set
performs well, both in constructing a metasearch list and
as a pool for the accurate evaluation of retrieval systems.
Our experimental results on TREC data demonstrate excel­lent 
performance in all measures---evaluation of systems, re­trieval 
of relevant documents, and generation of metasearch
lists.
