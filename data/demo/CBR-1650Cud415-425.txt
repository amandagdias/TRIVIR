Abstract - A case-based reasoning system for diagnosing medical equipment, 
called ELSI, has been in use by the GE corporation since 1994. When
a customer or field engineer calls the service center for help with a problem,
the equipment’s error log is automatically downloaded. In ninety seconds or
less, ELSI displays a sorted list of the best-matching logs in a case base of
previous known problems, shows the fix, service notes, explains which sections 
of the log match, and which fixes each section predicts. This diagnostic
information allows the service center engineer to recommend a temporary
work-around or remote fixes to a customer, or helps a field engineer show
up on site with the right parts the first time.
