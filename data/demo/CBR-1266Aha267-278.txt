Abstract. Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) shells (e.g., Inference’s 
CBR Express) are commercially successful tools for supporting
the development of help desk and related applications. In contrast to
rule-based expert systems, they capture knowledge as cases rather than
more problematic rules, and they can be incrementally extended. However, 
rather than eliminate the knowledge engineering bottleneck, they
refocus it on case engineering, the task of carefully authoring cases according 
to library design guidelines to ensure good performance. Designing 
complex libraries according to these guidelines is difficult; software is
needed to assist users with case authoring. We describe an approach for
revising case libraries according to design guidelines, its implementation
in CLIRE, and empirical results showing that, under some conditions, this
approach can improve conversational CBR performance.
