Abstract. Expert systems for decision support have recently been successfully 
introduced in road transport management. These systems include knowledge
 on traffic problem detection and alleviation. The paper
describes experiments in automated acquisition of knowledge on traffic
problem detection. The task is to detect road sections where a problem
has occured (critical sections) from sensor data. It is necessary to use
inductive logic programming (ILP) for this purpose as relational background 
knowledge on the road network is essential. In this paper, we
apply three state-of-the art ILP systems to learn how to detect traffic
problems and compare their performance to the performance of a propositional 
learning system on the same problem.
