ABSTRACT
In this paper I introduce the problem of displaying dynamic
information. I give several examples where an individual
must interact with information that is changing beyond her
control. The challenge in displaying this information is to
discover how the user's context can be maintained while
giving her access to the new information that becomes
available. The user should feel in control of the information
despite the fact that it is changing. This can be done
effectively by understanding what conceptual anchors the
user creates into the data, and keeping them constant while
changing the other information as needed.
