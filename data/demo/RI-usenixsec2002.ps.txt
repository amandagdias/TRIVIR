Abstract
An increasing number of countries and companies rou­tinely 
block or monitor access to parts of the Internet.
To counteract these measures, we propose Infranet, a sys­tem 
that enables clients to surreptitiously retrieve sensitive
content via cooperating Web servers distributed across the
global Internet. These Infranet servers provide clients access 
to censored sites while continuing to host normal un­censored 
content. Infranet uses a tunnel protocol that pro­vides 
a covert communication channel between its clients
and servers, modulated over standard HTTP transactions
that resemble innocuous Web browsing. In the upstream
direction, Infranet clients send covert messages to Infranet
servers by associating meaning to the sequence of HTTP
requests being made. In the downstream direction, Infranet
servers return content by hiding censored data in uncen­sored 
images using steganographic techniques. We describe
the design, a prototype implementation, security properties,
and performance of Infranet. Our security analysis shows
that Infranet can successfully circumvent several sophisti­cated 
censoring techniques.
