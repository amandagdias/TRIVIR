Abstract                                           
The goal of the presented project is a general compositonal environment for multimedia with 
interactive editing facilities. Multimedia presentations are regarded as hierarchical compositions
of time objects that define serial or parallel synchronisation of the inserted media  
objects. Such media composition hierarchies support automatic temporal layout mechanisms    
and are integrated into an object-oriented application framework that provides direct       
manipulative interaction on temporal structures through user interface components. In this  
papaer reusable and extendable components for audio and music processing are presented.
