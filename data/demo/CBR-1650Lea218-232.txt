Abstract. Case-based problem-solving systems reason and learn from
experiences, building up case libraries of problems and solutions to guide
future reasoning. The expected benefits of this learning process depend
on two types of regularity: (1) problem-solution regularity, the relationship 
between problem-to-problem and solution-to-solution similarity measures 
that assures that solutions to similar prior problems are a useful
starting point for solving similar current problems, and (2) problem-distribution 
regularity, the relationship between old and new problems
that assures that the case library will contain cases similar to the new
problems it encounters. Unfortunately, these types of regularity are not
assured. Even in contexts for which initial regularity is sufficient, problems 
may arise if a system’s users, tasks, or external environment change
over time. This paper defines criteria for assessing the two types of regularity, 
discusses how the definitions may be used to assess the need
for case-base maintenance, and suggests maintenance approaches for responding 
to those needs. In particular, it discusses the role of analysis of
performance over time in responding to environmental changes.
