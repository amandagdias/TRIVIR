Abstract. Software systems are becoming increasingly complex, demanding
for more computational resources and better software development methodologies. 
The software engineer and the CASE tool must work like a team. For this
to happen, the CASE tool must be able to understand the user, and to provide
new functionalities, such as flexible retrieval of old designs. We think that
Case-Based Reasoning can provide a reasoning framework capable of meeting
these demands. One important task that a CASE tool based on Case-Based Reasoning 
can perform adequately, is the retrieval of relevant designs. These designs 
can be stored in a case library, central to the software development company, 
thus enabling knowledge sharing through out the company. In this paper
we present an approach to case-based retrieval of software designs, and experimental 
results achieved with this approach.
