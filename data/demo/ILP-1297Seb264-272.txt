Abstract. A distance on the problem domain allows one to tackle some
typical goals of machine learning, e.g. classification or conceptual clustering, 
via robust data analysis algorithms (e.g. k-nearest neighbors or
k-means) .
A method for building a distance on first-order logic domains is presented
in this paper. The distance is constructed from examples expressed as
definite or constrained clauses, via a two-step process: a set of d hypotheses 
is first learnt from the training examples. These hypotheses serve as
new descriptors of the problem domain 4: they induce a mapping pi from
4 onto the space of integers Nd The distance between any two examples 
E and F is finally defined as the Euclidean distance between pi(E)
and pi(F). The granularity of this hypothesis-driven distance (HDD) is
controlled via the user-supplied parameter d.
The relevance of a HDD is evaluated from the predictive accuracy of the
k-NN classifier based on this distance. Preliminary experiments demonstrate 
the potentialities of distance induction, in terms of predictive accuracy, 
computational cost, and tolerance to noise.
