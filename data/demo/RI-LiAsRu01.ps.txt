ABSTRACT
This paper discusses online power­aware routing in large
sensor networks. We seek to optimize the lifetime of the
network. We develop an approximation algorithm called
max­min zPmin that has a good empirical competitive ra­tio. 
To ensure scalability, we introduce a hierarchical algo­rithm, which is called zone­based routing.
