Abstract. Despite the rapid emergence and success of Inductive Logic
Programming, problems still surround number handling—problems directly 
inherited from the choice of logic programs as the representation
language. Our conjecture is that a generalisation of the representation
language to Constraint Logic Programs provides an effective solution to
this problem. We support this claim with the presentation of an algorithm 
called NUM, to which a top-down refinement operator can delegate 
the task of finding numerical literals. NUM can handle equations,
in-equations and dis-equations in a uniform way, and, furthermore, provides 
more generality than competing approaches since numerical literals
are not required to cover all the positive examples available.
