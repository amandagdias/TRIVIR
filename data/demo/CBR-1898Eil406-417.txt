Abstract. A delivery robot navigating in the real world and contending
with multiple goals and priorities benefits from combining deliberative
and reactive planning. Deliberative planners anticipate and optimize actions, 
and manage multiple goals at once. Reactive planners respond flexibly 
and moment-to-moment to a changing world, based on incomplete
and flawed knowledge. This project proposes using case-based reasoning 
to fully integrate high-level and low-level planning techniques, along
with other reasoning tasks of the system. The resulting robot allows
case selection to mediate between methods. In addition, the robot learns
by recording new reactive behaviors, storing new plans it creates, and
introspective learning of retrieval features.
