Abstract
In the Case-Based Reasoning paradigm cases are often
given initially in natural language in the form of a “story”. While this
textual form is appropriate for humans, it is often not suitable for direct
application by a computer. Our paper uses the legal domain of
sentencing for criminal offences to illustrate an approach to indexing,
knowledge representation of stories and their application in reasoning.
This approach extends the well-known concept of Explanation Patterns.
