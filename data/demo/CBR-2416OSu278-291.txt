Abstract. Data Mining, or Knowledge Discovery as it is also known, is becoming 
increasingly useful in a wide variety of applications. In the following paper,
we look at its use in combating some of the traditional issues faced with recommender 
systems. We discuss our ongoing work which aims to enhance the
performance of PTV, an applied recommender system working in the TV listings 
domain. This system currently combines the results of separate user-based
collaborative and case-based components to recommend programs to users. Our
extension to this idea operates on the theory of developing a case-based view of
the collaborative component itself. By using data mining techniques to extract
relationships between programme items, we can address the sparsity/maintenance
problem. We also adopt a unique approach to recommendation ranking which
combines user similarities and item similarities to provide more effective recommendation 
orderings. Experimental results corroborate our ideas, demonstrating
the effectiveness of data mining in improving recommender systems by providing
similarity knowledge to address sparsity, both at user-based recommendation level
and recommendation ranking level.
