Abstract. One of the most prominent approaches in Inductive Logic
Programming is the use of least generalizations under subsumption of
given clauses. However, subsumption is weaker than logical implication,
and not very well suited for handling recursive clauses. Therefore an
important open question in this area concerns the existence of least generalizations
 under implication (LGIs). Our main new result in this paper
is the existence and computability of such an LGI for any finite set of
clauses which contains at least one non-tautologous function-free clause.
We can also define implication relative to background knowledge. In this
case, least generalizations only exist in a very limited case.
