Abstract. Collaborative filtering systems make recommendations based
on the accumulation of ratings by many users. The process has a case-based 
reasoning flavor: recommendations are generated by looking at
the behavior of other users who are considered similar. However, the
features associated with a user are semantically weak compared with
those used by CBR systems. This research examines multi-dimensional
or semantic ratings in which a system gets information about the reason
behind a preference. Experiments show that metrics in which the
semantic meaning of each rating is taken into account have markedly
superior performance than simpler techniques.
