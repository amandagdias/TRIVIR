ABSTRACT                                                                                  
In the Internet world, the widespread use of graphical     
user interfaces (GUIs) increasingly bars visually          
handicapped people from accessing digital                  
information. In this context our project aims at           
providing sight handicapped people with alternative        
access modalities to various types of GUIs and graphic    
intensive programs, in order for instance to facilitate   
usage of Web services. We describe in this paper AB-Web [1], 
a 3D-audio Web browser that allows blind         
computer users to explore Web pages, fill in forms,       
etc., using a 3D sonic rendering. We also present         
WebSound [2], a generic tool that permits to associate    
with each HTML tag a given sonic object (earcon or        
auditory icon). Finally, we describe a series of          
associated programs composed of the family of sonic       
games From Dots to Shapes [3], as well as of IDEA ,       
a tool that lets users comprehend simple drawings, as     
well as to create graphics.
