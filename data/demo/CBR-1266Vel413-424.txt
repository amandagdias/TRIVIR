Abstract. Planning by analogical reasoning is a learning method that consists
of the storage, retrieval, and replay of planning episodes. Planning performance
improves with the accumulation and reuse of a library of planning cases. Retrieval
is driven by domain-dependent similarity metrics based on planning goals and
scenarios. In complex situations with multiple goals, retrieval may find multiple
past planning cases that are jointly similar to the new planning situation. This
paper presents the issues and implications involved in the replay of multiple
planning cases, as opposed to a single one. Multiple case plan replay involves the
adaptation and merging of the annotated derivations of the planning cases. Several
merge strategies for replay are introduced that can process with various forms of
eagerness the differences between the past and new situations and the annotated
justifications at the planning cases. In particular, we introduce an effective merging
strategy that considers plan step choices especially appropriate for the interleaving
of planning and plan execution. We illustrate and discuss the effectiveness of the
merging strategies in specific domains.
