Abstract. This paper describes a new quantitative similarity metric for
cases comprising an episode represented by a problem/solution pair and
an interpretation in the form of a set of imperfect explanations.
Our explanation-based metric is an alternative to other approaches that
use case’s explanations for selection and retrieval. We analyse this metric
and present some examples.
We describe CLASH, a Case-Based Reasoning Expert System imple-
mented in PROLOG, which applies this metric. The results provided by
CLASH are compared with another system based on a different explanation-based 
metric for case retrieval.
