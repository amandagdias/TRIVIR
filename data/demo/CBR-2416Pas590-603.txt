Abstract. Estuaries are complex natural water systems. Their behaviour depend
on many factors, which are possible to analyse only by adopting different study
approaches. The physical processes within estuaries, such as floods and
pollutant dispersion, are generally investigated through computer modelling. In
this paper the application of case-based reasoning technology to support the
design of estuarine models is described. The system alms to provide a non-expert 
user in modelling with the necessary guidance for selecting a model that
matches his goal and the nature of the problem to be solved. The system is
based on three components: a case-based reasoning scheme, a genetic algorithm
and a library of numerical estuarine models. An example based on the Upper
Milford Haven estuary (UK) is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the system’s
structure for supporting estuarmne model design.
