Analogical Asides on Case-Based Reasoning

Abstract. This paper explores some of the similarities and differences
between cognitive models of analogy and case-based reasoning systems.
I first point out a paradox in the treatment of adaptation in analogy
and in case-based reasoning; a paradox which can be only resolved by
expanding the role of adaptation in cognitive models of analogy. Some
psychological research on the process of adaptation in human subjects
is reported and then the implications of this research are propagated
into analogy and then on into CBR. The argument is that some of the
existing stages in CBR should be integrated into a more stream-lined
architecture that would be more efficient than current schemes.
