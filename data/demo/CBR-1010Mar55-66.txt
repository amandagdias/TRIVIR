Abstract. CBRefurb is a case-based reasoning (CBR) system for the strategic cost
estimation for building refurbishment. This domain is characterised by many uncertainties
and variation. Its cost estimation involves large amount of interrelated factors whose
impact is difficult to assess. This paper report on the problems faced by the building cost
information Services (BCIS) databases and several rule-based expert systems to tackle
this complex cost estimation problem and, the design and evaluation of CBRefurb system
implemented using ReMind Shell. CBRefurb imitates the domain expert in its approach
of breaking down the whole building work into smaller work (building items) by
organising the refurbishment cases as a hierarchical structure composed of cases and
subcases. The process of estimation imitate the expert by considering only these pieces of
previous cases of similar situation (or context). For this purpose, CBRefurb defines some
of the building and its component (or items) features as a global context and local context
information used to classify cases and subcases into context cases and subcases, and to
decompose the cost estimation problem into adaptable subproblems. This is followed by a
two indexing schemes to suit the hierarchical structure of the case and the problem
decomposition and to allow classfication and retrieval of contextual cases. CBRefurb
features consolidate the aim of the project that is allowing multiple retrieval of
appropriate pieces of the refurbishment which are easier to adapt, reflecting the expert
method of estimating cost for complex refurbishment work.
