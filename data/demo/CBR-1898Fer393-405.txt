Abstract. Case-base maintenance is an important emerging issue for
case-base reasoners as they scale-up to handle real-world problems in
unstable environments. Overtime the contents of a case-base may
become out-of-date or inconsistent with the current target problem
space, and maintenance strategies must be devised to help recognise
and repair these problems, by deleting, adding, or modifying cases, for
example. In this paper we describe a maintenance framework called
collaborative maintenance (CM), which has been designed to facilitate,
monitor, and control the incremental up-date of live, dynamic case-bases. 
Our approach is novel in that it automatically supports a
distributed, interactive maintenance process — users are permitted to
recommend case updates and the collaborative maintenance process
ensures that these recommendations are properly reviewed and
actioned.
