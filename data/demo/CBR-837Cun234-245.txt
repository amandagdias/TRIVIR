Abstract. A major advantage in using a case-based approach to
developing knowledge-based systems is that it can be applied to problems
where a strong domain theory may be difficult to determine. However the
development of case-based reasoning (CBR) systems that set out to support
a sophisticated case adaptation process does require a strong domain model.
The Derivational Analogy (DA) approach to CBR is a case in point. In DA
the case representation contains a trace of the reasoning process involved
in producing the solution for that case. In the adaptation process this
reasoning trace is reinstantiated in the context of the new target case; this
requires a strong domain model and the encoding of problem solving
knowledge. In this paper we analyse this issue using as an example a CBR
system called CoBRA that assists with the modelling tasks in numerical
simulation.
