Abstract. A key concept in case-based reasoning is similarity. In this
paper, we first propose a similarity measure for structured representations 
that is based on graph edit operations. Then we show how this
similarity measure can be computed by means of state space search. Subsequently, 
subgraph isomorphism is considered as a special case of graph
similarity and a new efficient algorithm for its detection is proposed.
The new algorithm is particularly suitable if there is a large number of
library cases being tested against an input graph. Finally, we present experimental 
results showing the computational efficiency of the proposed
approach.
