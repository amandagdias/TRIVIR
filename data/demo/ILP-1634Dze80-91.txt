Abstract. We present a novel application of inductive logic programming 
(ILP) in the area of quantitative structure-activity relationships
(QSARs). The activity we want to predict is the biodegradability of
chemical compounds in water. In particular, the target variable is the
half-life in water for aerobic aqueous biodegradation. Structural descriptions 
of chemicals in terms of atoms and bonds are derived from the
chemicals’ SMILES encodings. Definition of substructures are used as
background knowledge. Predicting biodegradability is essentially a regression 
problem, but we also consider a discretized version of the target
variable. We thus employ a number of relational classification and regression 
methods on the relational representation and compare these to
propositional methods applied to different propositionalisations of the
problem. Some expert comments on the induced theories are also given.
