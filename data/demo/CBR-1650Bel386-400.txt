Abstract. The integration of rule-based and case-based reasoning is
particularly useful in medical applications, where both general rules aud
specific patient cases are usually available. In the present paper we aim at
presenting a decision support tool for Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus 
management relying on such a kind of integration. This multi—modal
reasoning system airirs at providing physicians with a simitable solution to
the problem of therapy planning by exploiting, in the most flexible way,
the strengths of the two selected methods. In particular, the integration is
pursued without considering one of the modality as the most prominent
reasoning method, but exploiting complementarity in all possible ways.
In fact, while rules provide suggestions on the basis of a situation detection 
mechanism that relies on structured prior knowledge, CBR may be
used to specialize and dynamically adapt the rules on the basis of the
patient’s characteristics armd of the accumulated experience. On the other
hand, if a particular patient class is not sufficiently covered by cases, the
use of rules may be exploited to try to learn suitable situations, in order
to improve the competence of the case-based component. Such a work
will be integrated in the EU funded project T-IDDM architecture, and
has been preliminary tested on a set of cases generated by a diabetic
patient simulator.
