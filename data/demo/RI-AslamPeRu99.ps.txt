Abstract
We present and analyze the off­line star algorithm for clus­tering 
static information systems and the on­line star algo­rithm 
for clustering dynamic information systems. These
algorithms organize a document collection into a number of
clusters that is naturally induced by the collection via a com­putationally 
efficient cover by dense subgraphs. We further
show a lower bound on the accuracy of the clusters produced
by these algorithms as well as demonstrate that these algo­rithms 
are efficient (running times roughly linear in the size
of the problem). Finally, we provide data from a number of
experiments.
