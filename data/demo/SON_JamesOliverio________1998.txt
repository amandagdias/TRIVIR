Abstract                         
While the traditional notion of "opera" describes a production that incorporates musical elements with other art
forms and media, the conceptual and technical considerations required to mount an electronic multimedia opera
add significant layers of complexity.  Design issues including projecting visual media, the implementing of an
immersive audio environment and maintaining synchronization (between live singers and digital music, 3D
computer animation, stage lighting and projected imagery) add to the standard list of compositional and
production challenges. An overview of the design and implementation of such a production, StarChild: The
Opera, offers a primer in the musical and extra-musical considerations that are required to realize a large-scale
composition in an electronic mixed media environment.
