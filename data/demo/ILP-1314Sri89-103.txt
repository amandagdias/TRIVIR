Abstract. Recently, computer programs developed within the field of
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have received some attention for
their ability to construct restricted first-order logic solutions using problem-specific 
background knowledge. Prominent applications of such programs
have been concerned with determining “structure-activity” relationships
in the areas of molecular biology and chemistry. Typically the task here
is to predict the “activity” of a compound, like toxicity, from its chemical
structure. Research in the area shows that: (a) ILP programs have been
restricted to qualitative predictions of activity (“high”, “low” etc.); (b)
When appropriate attributes are available, ILP programs have not been
able to better the performance of standard quantitative analysis techniques 
like linear regression. However ILP programs perform creditably
when such attributes are unavailable; and (c) When both are applicable,
ILP programs are usually slower than their propositional counterparts.
This paper examines the use of ILP programs, not for obtaining theories
complete for the sample, but as a method of “discovering” new attributes.
These could then be used by methods like linear regression, thus allowing
for quantitative predictions and the ability to use structural information
as background knowledge. Using structure-activity tasks as a test-bed
the utility of ILP programs in constructing new features was evaluated
by examining the prediction of chemical activity using linear regression,
with and without the aid of ILP learnt logical attributes. In three out
of the five datasets examined the addition of ILP attributes produced
statistically better results (P ¡0.01). In addition six important structural
features that have escaped the attention of the expert chemists were
discovered.
