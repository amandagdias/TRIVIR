ABSTRACT
When a digital library is decomposed into many geographi­cally 
distributed repositories, search efficiency becomes an is­sue. 
Increasing network congestion makes this a compelling
issue. We discuss an effective method for reducing the num­ber 
of servers needed to respond to a query and give examples
of search space reduction in the NCSTRL distributed digital
library.
