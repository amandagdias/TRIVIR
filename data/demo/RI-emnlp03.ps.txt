Abstract
This paper presents a bootstrapping process
that learns linguistically rich extraction pat­terns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.
High­precision classifiers label unannotated
data to automatically create a large training set,
which is then given to an extraction pattern
learning algorithm. The learned patterns are
then used to identify more subjective sentences.
The bootstrapping process learns many subjec­tive 
patterns and increases recall while main­taining high precision.
