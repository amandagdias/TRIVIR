ABSTRACT                                                                  

We describe a navigation tool for a collaborative Web space (CoWeb) containing meta information
on aggregated interaction history. We represent the history information by annotating links 
inside the CoWeb. The navigation tool presents all links on a page together with their meta 
information in a popup menu. A sonification gives an auditory overview of the distribution of
history information. The popup menu itself uses both conventional link markers as well as sound 
to communicate the meta information to the user.
