Abstract. Recommender systems combine user profiling and filtering
techniques to provide more pro-active and personal information retrieval
systems, and have been gaining in popularity as a way of overcoming the
ubiquitous information overload problem. Many recommender systems
operate as interactive systems that seek feedback from the end-user as
part of the recommendation process to revise the user’s query. In this
paper we examine different forms of feedback that have been used in the
past and focus on a low-cost preference-based feedback model, which to
date has been very much under utilised. In particular we describe and
evaluate a novel comparison-based recommendation framework which is
designed to utilise preference-based feedback. Specifically, we present results 
that highlight the benefits of a number of new query revision strategies 
and evidence to suggest that the popular more-like-this strategy may
be flawed.
