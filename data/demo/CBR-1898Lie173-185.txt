Abstract. This paper presents two applications for the breast cancer
treatment decision helping. The first one is called CASIMIR/RBR and can
be likened to a rule-based reasoning system. In some situations, the application 
of the rules of this system does not provide a satisfying treatment.
Then, the application CASIMIR/CBR—which is not fully implemented-can be used. 
CASIMIR/CBR uses principles of case-based reasoning in order 
to suggest solutions by adapting the rules of CASIMIR/RBR. In this
framework, the rules are considered as cases: they are adapted rather
than used literally.
