Abstract. In this paper, we present three techniques for knowledge discovery in
case-based reasoning. The first two techniques D-HS and D-HS+SR are
concerned with the discovery of similarity knowledge and operate on an
uncompacted case-base while the third technique D-HS+PSR is concerned with
the discovery of both similarity and case knowledge and operates on a
compacted case-base. All three techniques provide a very efficient and
competent means of similarity determination in CBR, which are empirically
shown to be up to 25 times faster than k-NN without any loss in competency.
D-HS+PSR proposes a novel approach to automatically engineering compact
case-bases with a minimal overhead to the system, compared to other
approaches such as case deletion/addition. Additionally as the approach
provides a means for automatically reducing the number of cases required in the
case-base without any loss in problem solving competency it has the greatest
implication of the three techniques for reducing the effects of the utility
problem in CBR.
