Abstract
We propose a method to generate large­scale
encyclopedic knowledge, which is valuable
for much NLP research, based on the Web.
We first search the Web for pages contain­ing 
a term in question. Then we use lin­guistic 
patterns and HTML structures to ex­tract 
text fragments describing the term. Fi­nally, 
we organize extracted term descrip­tions 
based on word senses and domains. In
addition, we apply an automatically gener­ated 
encyclopedia to a question answering
system targeting the Japanese Information­
Technology Engineers Examination.
