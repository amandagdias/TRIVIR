Abstract. This paper presents a new approach for learning general
knowledge in a diagnostic case-based system through the use of a neural 
network. We take advantage of the self-adapting nature of the neural 
network to discover the most relevant features and combination of
features for each diagnosis considered. The knowledge acquired by the
network is interpreted and mapped into symbolic diagnosis descriptors,
which are kept and used by the case-based system to guide its reasoning
process, to retrieve cases from a case library and to build explanations.
The neural network used in the learning process was the Combinatorial
Neural Model, a network that has been combined with other symbolic
approaches previously. The paper presents the method used to interpret
the knowledge learned in the neural network, as well as the guidelines
followed by the reasoning process of the CBR system. An initial experiment 
in clinical psychology is also reported, where the case-based model
introduced here was used to learn and represent the psychological proffle
of patients in evaluation for heart transplant.
