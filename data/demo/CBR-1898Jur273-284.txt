Abstract. This paper presents an approach to realize a case retrieval
engine on top of a relational database. In a nutsheli the core idea is to
approximate a similarity-based retrieval with SQL-queries. The approach
avoids duplicating the case data or compiling index structures and is
therefore ideal for huge case bases which are often subject to changes. The
presented approach is fully implemented as part of the commercial CBR
toolbox orenge and the experimental evaluation demonstrates impressive
retrieval behaviour.
