Abstract. CBROnto is an ontology that incorporates common Case-Based 
Reasoning (CBR) terminology and serves as a domain-independ-
ent framework to design CBR applications. It is the core of COLIBRI,
an environment to assist during the design of knowledge intensive CBR
systems that combine cases with various knowledge types and reasoning
methods. CBROnto captures knowledge about CBR tasks and methods,
and aims to unify case specific and general domain knowledge representational 
needs. CBROnto specifies a modelling framework to describe
reusable CBR Problem Solving Methods based on the CBR tasks they
solve. This paper describes CBROnto’s main ideas and exemplifies them
with an application to generate Spanish poetry versions of texts provided
by the user.
