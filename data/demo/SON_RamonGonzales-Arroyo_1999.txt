A Series of Three Mixed Reality Workshops: Sounding Out – Sound in Mixed Reality Environment

ABSTRACT                      
The second workshop in the series of practical mixed reality workshops, defined in
Workpackage 7b.1, focusses on sound. This is the topic with which most of the eRENA
partners have to deal: finding technical and aesthetic solutions for sound, within an image
oriented mixed environment. Virtual (and mixed) reality environments often lack a
convincing solution for all aspects of sound.
The  workshop took place at the ZKM, on December, 2nd and 3rd 1999. Five lectures
and demonstrations, presented by eRENA partner’s collaborators, alternated with
discussions among the participants.
The deliverable documents the content of the workshop structured in four parts: sound
in relation to its form of data, in relation to space, to image, and to interaction. One of the
achievements of the workshop was in showing how many different relationships are
existing around these four aspects. Artistic and pragmatic use of sound in mixed reality
environments were regarded as well as the different accesses to visual and audio matters.

genetic graphics and sound. SonoMorphis has been shown at the exhibition surrog,ate                     
Nov 1st - Dec 6th 1998 at the ZKM Institute for Visual Media. The image was projected                   
onto the front wall of a room of 6m width and 7m depth. The projection size was 5 x 3m.                 
The interface consists out of a mixing board plus chair which were installed 4,50m in                   
front of the screen. The image was projected in stereo using Chrystal Eyes Shutter                      
Glasses. The moving sound sources were projected quadrophonically with two speakers                     
in front and two in the rear. SonoMorphis has also been shown during the 11th Stuttgarter               
Filmwinter, Jan 14th - 17th 1999, in the CAVE of the IAO, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in                    
Stuttgart. The user interface was located in front of the CAVE.
