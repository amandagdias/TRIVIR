Abstract. Building a methodology for developing and maintaining CBR
applications is an important goal currently addressed by CBR researchers
and practitioners. Since GBR application development is a special kind
of software development, building a CBR methodology can certainly be
viewed as a software engineering research and development activity. This
paper presents a perspective of how software process modeling, which is
a recent approach in software engineering, can be used for building a
case-based reasoning methodology. Further we describe a case study to
show the applicability of the proposed concepts.
