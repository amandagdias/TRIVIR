Abstract. Two contributions are sketched. A first contribution shows
that a special case of relational learning can be transformed into attribute-value 
learning. However, it is much more tractable to stick to the relational 
representation than to apply the sketched transformation. This
provides a sound theoretical justification for inductive logic programming. 
In a second contribution, we show how existing attribute-value
learning techniques and systems can be upgraded towards inductive logic
programming using the ‘Leuven’ methodology and illustrate it using the
Claudien, Tilde, ICL, Warmr, TIC, MacCent and RRL systems.
