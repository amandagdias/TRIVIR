Abstract
In this paper we propose a new theoretical method for combining both content
and link structure analysis for Web information retrieval. This approach is based
on performing a random walk on a modified Markov chain, induced from the Web
graph. This new model is applicable either in a static way, where a global pres­tige 
score is computed for every document, or in a dynamic way, where the link
structure of the results from a first pass retrieval is taken into account. The results
of experiments on the TREC WT10g and .GOV collections show that it is a robust
method, particularly suitable for dynamic link analysis. Moreover, we show that it
outperforms PageRank under the same experimental settings.
