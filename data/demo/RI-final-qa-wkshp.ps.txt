Abstract
In this paper we analyze two question
answering tasks : the TREC­8 ques­tion answering 
task and a set of reading
comprehension exams. First, we show
that Q/A systems perform better when
there are multiple answer opportunities
per question. Next, we analyze com­mon 
approaches to two subproblems:
term overlap for answer sentence iden­tification, 
and answer typing for short
answer extraction. We present general
tools for analyzing the strengths and
limitations of techniques for these sub­-problems. 
Our results quantify the limi­tations 
of both term overlap and answer
typing to distinguish between compet­ing answer candidates.
