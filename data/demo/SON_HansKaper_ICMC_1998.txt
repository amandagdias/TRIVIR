Abstract                                        
An interdisciplinary project encompassing sound synthesis, music composition, sonification, and
visualization of music is facilitated by the high-performance computing capabilities and the virtual-reality
environments available at Argonne National Laboratory.  The paper describes the main features of the
project's centerpiece, DIASS (Digital Instrument for Additive Sound Synthesis); "A.N.L.-folds", an
equivalence class of compositions produced with DIASS; and aplication of DIASS in two experiments in
the sonification of complex scientific data.  Some of the larger issues connected with this project, such as
the changing ways in which both scientists and composers perform their tasks, are briefly discussed.
