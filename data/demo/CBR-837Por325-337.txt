Abstract. The aim of this paper is to present an approach to the integration 
of Case-Based Reasoning with Model-Based Reasoning in diagnostic 
problem solving. Such an integration is exploited by defining
adaptation criteria on solutions retrieved by a case-based reasoner, in
order to focus the model-based reasoner in the search for the solution
of the current case and avoiding, as much as possible, the computation
of the solution from scratch. Such adaptation criteria strictly rely on a
formal theory of diagnosis that allows us to define different adaptation
levels, relative to the trade-off between “accuracy of the solution” and
“computational effort”. A simple example in the domain of car engine
faults is presented and some important aspects are finally pointed out
on the basis of our preliminary experiments.
