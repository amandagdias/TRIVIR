Summary

A building design task can be viewed according to many different abstractions. For example,
an architect views a building as a collection of spaces with particular properties, while a civil
engineer might consider it to be a structure made up of load-bearing elements. In order to produce
a workable design, it is important to be able to combine these different viewpoints. Difficulties
associated with combining viewpoints lead to what we term the integration problem. The case-based 
design (CBD) methodology presented in this paper provides an opportunity to model the
intentions of several professions and trades using cases of previous good designs. Therefore,
CBD provides pre-formulated solutions to integration problems. We describe a prototype design
system, CADRE, which applies CBD to several examples of building design.
