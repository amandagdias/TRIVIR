ABSTRACT
In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis of peer­to­peer (P2P)
networks operating in the face of concurrent joins and unexpected
departures. We focus on Chord, a recently developed P2P system
that implements a distributed hash table abstraction, and study the
process by which Chord maintains its distributed state as nodes join
and leave the system. We argue that traditional performance mea­sures 
based on run­time are uninformative for a continually running
P2P network, and that the rate at which nodes in the network need
to participate to maintain system state is a more useful metric. We
give a general lower bound on this rate for a network to remain con­nected, 
and prove that an appropriately modified version of Chord's
maintenance rate is within a logarithmic factor of the optimum rate.
