Abstract. The paper discusses the different aspects concerning performance 
arising in multi-modal systems combining Case-Based Reasoning
and Model-Based Reasoning for diagnostic problem solving. In particular, 
we examine the relation among speed-up of problems solving, competence 
of the system and quality of produced solutions. Because of the
well-know utility problem, there is no general strategy for improving all
these parameters at the same time, so the trade-off among such parameters 
must he carefully analyzed. We have developed a case memory
management strategy which allows the interleaving of learning of new
cases with forgetting phases, where useless and potentially dangerous
cases are identified and removed. This strategy, combined with a suitable 
tuning on the precision required for the retrieval of cases (in terms
of estimated adaptation cost), provides an effective mechanism for taking
under control the utility problem. Experimental analysis performed on a
real-world domain shows in fact that improvements over both speed-up
and competence can be obtained, without compromising in a significant
way the quality of solutions.
