Abstract. This paper describes a software tool called CALIBRE (Candidate
Library Retrieval). The tool incorporates case-base reasoning to support the
extraction of candidate lists for targeted marketing campaigns. The tool has
been aimed at users in the marketing domain. This domain is characterised by
very large databases containing many Terabytes of customer related information. 
Large systems such as these require careful management of the queries
being submitted to optimise the use of processing and storage resources. The
CBR approach encourages consistent best practice as well as cutting down on
valuable negotiation time. An early prototype has been built and is currently
used for experimental purposes.
