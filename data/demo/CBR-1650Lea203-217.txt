Abstract. Because of the complexity of aerospace design, intelligent
systems to support and amplify the abilities of aerospace designers have
the potential for profound impact on the speed and reliability of design 
generation. This article describes a framework for supporting the
interactive capture of design cases and their application to new problems, 
illustrating the approach with a discussion of its use in a support
system for aircraft design. The project integrates case-based reasoning
with interactive tools for capturing expert design knowledge through
“concept mapping.” Concept mapping tools provide crucial functions
for interactively generating and examining design cases and navigating
their hierarchical structure, while CBR techniques provide capabilities
to facilitate retrieval and to aid interactive adaptation of designs. The
project aims simultaneously to develop a useful design aid and more generally 
to develop practical interactive approaches to fundamental issues
of case acquisition and representation, context-sensitive retrieval, and
case adaptation.
