ABSTRACT                                                                                                                
The research presented here addresses how line          
graphs can be made accessible to blind and visually     
impaired people through the use of non-speech audio.    
Previous research has focused on the sonification of a  
single data series.  This paper describes a method of   
sonifying two data series, and the design of two        
modes (parallel mode and serial mode) for browsing      
the graphs. Quantitative evaluation showed that both    
browsing modes were successful, with the parallel       
mode being particularly effective.
