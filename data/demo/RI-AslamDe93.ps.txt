Abstract
We derive general bounds on the complexity of
learning in the Statistical Query model and in the
PAC model with classification noise. We do so by
considering the problem of boosting the accuracy of
weak learning algorithms which fall within the Statis­tical 
Query model. This new model was introduced
by Kearns [12] to provide a general framework for ef­ficient 
PAC learning in the presence of classification
noise.
We first show a general scheme for boosting the ac­curacy 
of weak SQ learning algorithms, proving that
weak SQ learning is equivalent to strong SQ learn­
ing. The boosting is eficient and is used to show
our main result of the first general upper bounds
on the complexity of strong SQ learning. Specifi­cally, 
we derive simultaneous upper bounds with re­
spect to # on the number of queries, O(log 2 1
#
), the
Vapnik­Chervonenkis dimension of the query space,
O(log 1
#
log log 1
#
), and the inverse of the minimum tol­
erance, O( 1
#
log 1
#
). In addition, we show that these
general upper bounds are nearly optimal by describing
a class of learning problems for which we simultane­ously 
lower bound the number of queries
by#251 1
#
)
and the inverse of the minimum tolerance by # 1
#
).
We further apply our boosting results in the SQ
model to learning in the PAC model with classification
noise. Since nearly all PAC learning algorithms can be
cast in the SQ model, we can apply our boosting tech­niques 
to convert these PAC algorithms into highly
eficient SQ algorithms. By simulating these eficient
SQ algorithms in the PAC model with classification
noise, we show that nearly all PAC algorithms can be
converted into highly eficient PAC algorithms which
tolerate classification noise. We give an upper bound
on the sample complexity of these noise­tolerant PAC
algorithms which is nearly optimal with respect to the
noise rate. We also give upper bounds on space com­plexity 
and hypothesis size and show that these two
measures are in fact independent of the noise rate.
We note that the running times of these noise­tolerant
PAC algorithms are eficient.
This sequence of simulations also demonstrates that
it is possible to boost the accuracy of nearly all PAC
algorithms even in the presence of noise. This provides
a partial answer to an open problem of Schapire [15]
and the first theoretical evidence for an empirical re­sult 
of Drucker, Schapire and Simard [4].
