Abstract. The retrieval of similar cases is often performed by using the
neighborhood of a new problem. The neighborhood is usually defined
by a certain fixed number of most similar cases (k nearest neighbors) to
the problem. This paper deals with an alternative definition of neighborhood 
that comprises the cases within a certain distance, d, from the
problem. We present an average-case analysis of a classifier, the d-nearest
neighborhood method (d-NNh), that retrieves cases in this neighborhood
and predicts their majority class as the class of the problem. Our analysis
deals with rn-of-n/i target concepts, and handles three types of noise. We
formally compute the expected classification accuracy of d-NNh, then we
explore the predicted behavior of d-NNh. By combining this exploration
for d-NNh and one for k-nearest neighbor method (k-NN) in our previous
study, we compare the predicted behavior of each in noisy domains. Our
formal analysis is supported with Monte Carlo simulations.
