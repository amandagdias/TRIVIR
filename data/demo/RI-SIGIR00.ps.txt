Abstract The proliferation of online information resources
increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed
searching. Distributed searching is cast in three parts -- database
selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper
we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval perfor­mance. 
We look at retrieval performance in three different dis­tributed 
retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First
we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval
effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database.
Second we find that good performance can be achieved when
only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally
increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when
database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain
collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local in­
formation can be used to achieve superior performance. This
means that distributed systems can be engineered with more
autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that im­provements 
in database selection can lead to broader improve­ments 
in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single
database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good se­lection 
mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by
decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selec­tion step.
