Abstract. Inductive logic programming (ILP) is built on a foundation
laid by research in other areas of computational logic. But in spite of this
strong foundation, at 10 years of age ILP now faces a number of new 
challenges brought on by exciting application opportunities. The purpose of
this paper is to interest researchers from other areas of computational
logic in contributing their special skill sets to help JLP meet these 
challenges. The paper presents five future research directions for LLP and
points to initial approaches or results where they exist. It is hoped that
the paper will motivate researchers from throughout computational logic
to invest some time into “doing” ILP.
