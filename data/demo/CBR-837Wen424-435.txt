Abstract. This paper presents a case-based simulation environment devised
to assist neurophysiologists in the design and analysis of simulation experiments 
with biologically realistic neural networks. We describe the problem
domain and our specific notion of a case, discuss the complex structure of
such cases and present a method to automatically transform the numerical
raw data derived from simulations into a symbolic behavioral description that
can be used for further inferences by the system.
