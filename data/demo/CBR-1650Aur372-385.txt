Abstract. Reliable and effective maintenance support is a vital consideration
for the management within today’s manufacturing environment. This paper discusses 
the development a maintenance system for the world largest robot
welding facility. The developed system combines a case-based reasoning approach 
for diagnosis with context information, as electronic on-line manuals,
linked using open hypermedia technology. The work discussed in this paper
delivers not only a maintenance system for the robot stations under consideration, 
but also a design framework for developing maintenance systems for other
similar applications.
