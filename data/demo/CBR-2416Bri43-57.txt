Abstract. We describe Order-Based Retrieval, which is an approach to
case retrieval based on the application of partial orders to the case base.
We argue that it is well-suited to product recommender applications because, 
as well as retrieving products that best match customer-specified
‘ideal’ attribute-values, it also: allows the customer to specify soft constraints; 
gives a natural semantics and implementation to tweaks; and
delivers an inherently diverse result set.
