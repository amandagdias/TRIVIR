Reliable Communication over Partially Authenticated
Networks

Abstract
Reliable communication between parties in a network is a basic requirement for
executing any protocol. In this work, we consider the effect on reliable communication
when some pairs of parties have common authentication keys. The pairs sharing keys
define a natural ``authentication graph'', which may be quite different from the ``com­munication 
graph'' of the network. We characterize when reliable communication is
possible in terms of these two graphs, focusing on the very strong setting of a Byzantine
adversary with unlimited computational resources.
