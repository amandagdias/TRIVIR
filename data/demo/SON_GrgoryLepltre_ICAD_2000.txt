ABSTRACT                                                                    
This paper describes a framework for integrating non-speech audio to hierarchical menu structures where the visual feedback
is limited. In the rst part of this paper, emphasis is put on how to extract sound design principles from actual navigation
problems. These design principles are then applied in the second part, through the design, implementation and evaluation of a
set of sounds in a computer-based simulation of the Nokia 6110 mobile phone. The evaluation indicates that non-speech sound
improves the performance of navigational tasks in terms of the number of errors made and the number of keypresses taken to
complete the given tasks. This study provides both theoretical and practical insights about the design of audio cues intended to
support navigation in complex menu structures.
