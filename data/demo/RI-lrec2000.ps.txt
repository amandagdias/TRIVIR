Abstract
In information retrieval research, precision and recall have long been used to evaluate IR systems. However, given that
a number of retrieval systems resembling one another are already available to the public, it is valuable to retrieve novel
relevant documents, i.e., documents that cannot be retrieved by those existing systems. In view of this problem, we
propose an evaluation method that favors systems retrieving as many novel documents as possible. We also used our
method to evaluate systems that participated in the IREX workshop.
