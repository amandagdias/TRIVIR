Abstract. Locomotives, like many modem complex machines, are equipped
with the capability to generate on-board fault messages indicating the presence
of anomalous conditions. Such messages tend to generate in large quantities
and difficult and time consuming to interpret manually. This paper presents the
design and development of a case-based reasoning system for diagnosing locomotive 
faults using such fault messages as input. The process of using his-
torical repair data and expert input for case generation and validation is described. 
An algorithm for case matching is presented along with some results
on pilot data.
