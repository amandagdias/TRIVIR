Abstract. Case-based classification is a powerful classification method,
which (in its simplest form) assigns a target case to the same class as
the nearest of n previously classified cases. Many case-based classifiers
use the simple nearest-neighbour technique to identify the nearest case,
but this means comparing the target case to all of the stored cases at
classification time, resulting in high classification costs. For this reason
many techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of case-based 
classifiers by reducing the search they must perform. In this paper
we will look at editing techniques that preserve the lazy-learning quality
of case-based classification, hut improve classification performance.
