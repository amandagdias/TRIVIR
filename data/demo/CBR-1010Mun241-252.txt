Abstract. Structured domains are characterized by the fact that there
is an intrinsic dependency between certain key elements in the domain.
Considering these dependencies leads to better performance of the planning 
systems, and it is an important factor for determining the relevance
of the cases stored in a case-base. However, testing for cases that meet
these dependencies, decreases the performance of case-based planning, as
other criterions need also to be consider for determining this relevance.
We present a domain-independent architecture that explicitly represents
these dependencies so that retrieving relevant cases is ensured without
negatively affecting the performance of the case-based planning process.
