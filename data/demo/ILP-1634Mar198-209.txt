Abstract. Shinohara, Arimura, and Krishna Rao have shown learnability 
in the limit of minimal models of classes of logic programs from positive 
only data. In most cases, these results involve logic programs in
which the “size” of the head yields a bound on the size of the body literals. 
However, when local variables are present, such a bound on body
literal size cannot directly be ensured. The above authors achieve such
a restriction using technical notions like mode and linear inequalities.
The present paper develops a conceptually clean framework where the
behavior of local variables is controlled by nonlocal ones. It is shown that
for certain classes of logic programs, learnablity from positive data is
equivalent to limiting identification of bounds for the number of clauses
and the number of local variables. This reduces the learning problem
finding two integers. This cleaner framework generalizes all the known
results and establishes learnability of new classes.
