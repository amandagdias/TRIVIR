This paper describes the design of user-interface widgets that include non-speech sound. Previous research has shown
that the addition of sound can improve the usability of human-computer interfaces. However, there is little research to
show where the best places are to add sound to improve usability. The approach described here is to integrate sound into
widgets, the basic components of the human-computer interface. An overall structure for the integration of sound is
presented. There are many problems with current graphical widgets and many of these are difficult to correct by using
more graphics. This paper presents many of the standard graphical widgets and describes how sound can be added. It
describes in detail the usability problems with the widgets and then the non-speech sounds to overcome them. The non-
speech sounds used are earcons. These sonically-enhanced widgets allow designers who are not sound-experts to create
interfaces that effectively improve usability and have coherent and consistent sounds.
