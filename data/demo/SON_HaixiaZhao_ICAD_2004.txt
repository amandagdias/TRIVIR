ABSTRACT                                      
We present an Auditory Information Seeking Principle (AISP)                             
(gist, navigate, filter, and details-on-demand) modeled after the                       
visual information seeking mantra [1]. We propose that data                             
sonification designs should conform to this principle. We also                          
present some design challenges imposed by human auditory                                
perception characteristics. To improve blind access to geo-referenced 
statistical data, we developed two preliminary        
sonifications adhering to the above AISP, an enhanced table and  
a spatial choropleth map. Our pilot study shows people can                              
recognize geographic data distribution patterns on a real map                           
with 51 geographic regions, in both designs. The study also                             
shows evidence that AISP conforms to people’s information                               
seeking strategies. Future work is discussed, including the                             
improvement of the choropleth map design.
