Abstract
A well known result from complex analysis allows us, under suitable circum­stances, 
to compute the number of roots of an analytic function, f(z), that lie
inside a counterclockwise, simple closed curve, C, by computing the integral,
We employ interval arithmetic and automatic differentiation to give an au­tomatic 
and guaranteed bound on the integral. Furthermore, we explore the
interplay of the choice of curve C, the location of the roots relative to C, the
number of subdivisions, and the arithmetic precision used, upon the time nec­essary 
to obtain satisfactory bounds.
