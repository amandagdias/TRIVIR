Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is often used for petiodical inspection of infrastructure 
(e.g. railroads, pipelines). The inspection results in huge amounts of data
which usually has to be analysed by an operator (or a team of operators) for occurrence 
of defect indications. ‘This paper presents an example of use of case-based reasoning 
in interpretation of data from non-destructive testing, namely, a prototype for
classification of images from an ultrasonic rail-inspection system. The reasons for the
choice of case-based reasoning instead of statistical classification or a rule-based expert-system 
approach are explained. The overall design of the prototype is described
and observations and conclusions relating to the prototype and generally to the use of
CBR for NDT are presented.
