Abstract. Nowadays, the complexity involved in computer network fault
management demands a great amount of information about the involved
technologies and their associated problems. Besides, Trouble Ticket Systems
have been used to store the occurred problems, actuating as an historical
memory of the network. Thus, a correct approach to consolidate the network
historic memory is the development of an expert system that takes in account
the knowledge accumulated in the Trouble Ticket Systems to propose
solutions for an average problem. This work presents a system that uses Case-Based 
Reasoning paradigm applied to a Trouble Ticket System to suggest
solutions for a new problem occurred. This system aims to aid diagnosis and
resolution stages of network management problems. Typical problems of this
domain, the proposed solution and results reached with the developed
prototype are described.
