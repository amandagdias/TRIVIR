Abstract. This paper presents the Case-Based Reasoning Real-Time Scheduling 
System (CBR-RTS) that integrates into a case-based reasoning framework a
heuristic search component. The problem addressed involves scheduling sets of
tasks with precedence, ready time and deadline constraints. CBR-RTS reuses
the solution of known cases to simplify and solve new problems. When the
system does not have applicable cases, it tries to find a solution using heuristic
search. A particularly interesting feature of CBR-RTS is its learning ability.
New problems solved by the heuristic scheduler can be added to the case base
for future reuse. Performed tests have shown that small bases of cases carefully
chosen allow to substantially reduce the time needed to solve new complex
problems
