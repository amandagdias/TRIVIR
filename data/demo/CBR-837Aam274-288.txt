Abstract. Problem solving in weak theory domains should compensate for
the lack of strong theories by combining the various other knowledge types
involved. Such methods should be able to effectively combine general
domain knowledge with specific case knowledge. A method is described that
utilises a presumably extensive and dense model of general domain
knowledge as explanatory support for case-based problem solving and
learning. A generic reasoning method - captured in what is called the
ACTIVATE-EXPLAIN-FOCUS cycle - is able to utilise a rich knowledge model in
producing context-dependent explanations. A specialisation of this method
for each of the main subprocesses of case-based reasoning is presented, and
illustrated with examples.
