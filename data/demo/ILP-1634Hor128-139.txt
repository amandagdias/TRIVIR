Abstract. From the point of view of computational linguistics, Hungarian 
is a difficult language due to its complex grammar and rich morphology. 
This means that even a common task such as part-of-speech tagging
presents a new challenge for learning when looked at for the Hungarian
language, especially given the fact that this language has fairly free word
order. In this paper we therefore present a case study designed to illustrate 
the potential and limits of current ILP and non-ILP algorithms
on the Hungarian POS-tagging task. We have selected the popular C4.5
and Progol systems as propositional and ILP representatives, adding experiments 
with our own methods AGLEARN, a C4.5 preprocessor based
on attribute grammars, and the ILP approaches PHM and RIBL. The
systems were compared on the Hungarian version of the multilingual
morphosyntactically annotated MULTEXT-East TELRJ corpus which
consists of about 100.000 tokens. Experimental results indicate that Hungarian 
POS-tagging is indeed a challenging task for learning algorithms,
that even simple background knowledge leads to large differences in accuracy, 
and that instance-based methods are promising approaches to
POS tagging also for Hungarian. The paper also includes experiments
with some different cascade connections of the taggers.
