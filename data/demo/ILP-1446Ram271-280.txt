Abstract. Several learning systems, such as systems based on clustering
and instance based learning, use a measure of distance between objects.
Good measures of distance exist when objects are described by a fixed set
of attributes as in attribute value learners. More recent learning systems
however, use a first order logic representation. These systems represent
objects as models or clauses. This paper develops a general framework
for distances between such objects and reports a preliminary evaluation.
