Abstract. Case combination is a difficult problem in Case Based Reasoning, 
as sub-cases often exhibit conflicts when merged together. In our
previous work we formalized case combination by representing each case
as a constraint satisfaction problem, and used the minimum conflicts
algorithm to systematically synthesize the global solution. However, we
also found instances of the problem in which the minimum conflicts algorithm 
does not perform case combination efficiently. In this paper we
describe those situations in which initially retrieved cases are not easily
adaptable, and propose a method by which, to improve case adaptability
with a genetic algorithm. We introduce a fitness function that maintains
as much retrieved case information as possible, while also perturbing
a sub-solution to allow subsequent case combination to proceed more
efficiently.
