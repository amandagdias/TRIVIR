Abstract

Although CBR has been advertised as a technique to elude knowledge engineering (RE), 
we argue that knowledge-level modeling in KE is of eminent importance 
to the success of CBR systems, both for practical and theoretical reasons.
Cases are knowledge structures linked to some underlying database (although
not necessarily in a one-to-one fashion), and in order to define case structures
and their relations to the database, domain knowledge is needed. In this paper,
we focus on KE for CBR in the domain of architectural design, first looking at
general analyses of work processes and information use, then discussing micro-analyses 
of task structure in order to define case size, finally proceeding to
knowledge-level evaluation of the domain knowledge acquired and modeled so
far.
