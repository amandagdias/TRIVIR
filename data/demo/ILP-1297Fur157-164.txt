Abstract. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for the existence
of the moat specific hypothesis (MSH) in Progol. Muggleton [2] showed
that for any first order theory (background knowledge) B and a single
clause (a positive example) E, there exists the most specific hypothesis
-bot(B, E) which satisfies B A -bot(B, E) |= E and for any hypothesis
H satisfying B A H |= E, H entails bot(B, E) assuming that hypotheses
are all single clauses. Yamamoto[8] gave a counter example and indicated
that Muggleton’s proof contains error. He also gave a sufficient condition
under which the MSH exists. In this paper, we give another and more
realistic sufficient condition to guarantee the existence of the MSH.
