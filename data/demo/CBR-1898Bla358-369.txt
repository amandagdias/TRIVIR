Abstract. We present COOL-TOUR, a WEB-based Case Based Reasoning 
system for tourism culture support. Its main goal is to build the
community of tourists that are interested in a geographic area. Building
communities is relevant for e-commerce and CBR can support it effectively. 
Users interact with the system entering tours for accessing auxiliary 
services. The tours are stored in a case base and other users can retrieve 
and adapt them. The community is built around these stored experiences. 
The implemented version of COOL—TOUR deals with Mountain
Bike tours, providing a sketch-based interaction interface. The spatial
data similarity assessment is based on spatial indexing.
