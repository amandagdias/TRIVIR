Abstract. The regression problem is to approximate a function from
sample values. Decision trees and decision rules achieve this task by
finding regions with constant function values. While recursive partitioning 
methods are strong in dynamic feature selection and in explanatory
capabilities, an essential weakness of these methods is the approximation
of a region by a constant value. We propose a new method that relies
on searching for similar cases to boost performance. The new method
preserves the strengths of the partitioning schemes while compensating
for the weaknesses that are introduced with constant-value regions. Our
method relies on searching for the most relevant cases using a rule-based
system, and then using these cases for determining the function value.
Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can often yield
superior regression performance.
