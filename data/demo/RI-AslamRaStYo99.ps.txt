Improved Bicriteria Existence Theorems for Scheduling

Two common objectives for evaluating a schedule
are the makespan, or schedule length, and the average
completion time. In this note, we give improved bounds
on the existence of schedules that simultaneously opti­mize 
both criteria.
In a scheduling problem, we are given n jobs and
m machines. With each job j we associate a non­
negative weight w j . A schedule is an assignment of
jobs to machines over time, and yields a completion
time C j for each job j. We then define the average
completion time as # n
j=1 w j C j and the makespan as
Cmax = max j C j . We use C opt
max
and # w j C #
j
to denote
the optimal makespan and average completion time.
We will give results which will hold for a wide vari­ety 
of combinatorial scheduling problems. In particular,
we require that valid schedules for the problem satisfy
two very general conditions. First, if we take a valid
schedule S and remove from it all jobs that complete
after time t, the schedule remains a valid schedule for
those jobs that remain. Second, given two valid sched­ules 
S 1 and S 2 for two sets J 1 and J 2 of jobs (where
J 1 # J 2 is potentially nonempty), the composition of S 1
and S 2 , obtained by appending S 2 to the end of S 1 , and
removing from S 2 all jobs that are in J 1 # J 2 , is a valid
schedule for J 1 # J 2 .
For the rest of this note we will make claims about
``any'' scheduling problem, and mean any problem that
satisfies the two conditions above. In addition, if a
schedule has Cmax # #C opt
max
and # w j C j
# # # w j C # j
we call S an (#, #)­schedule.
Stein and Wein [7] recently gave a powerful but
simple theorem on the existence of schedules which are
simultaneously good approximations for makespan and
for average completion time. They showed that for any
scheduling problem, there exists a (2, 2)­schedule. The
construction is simple. We take an optimal average
completion time schedule and replace the subset J # of
jobs that finish after time C opt
max
by an optimal makespan
schedule for J # . The schedule has length at most 2C opt
max
,
and the completion time of each job at most doubles,
thus we obtain a (2,2)­schedule.
In the (2,2)­schedule, C opt
max
was the break­point, the
point at which we truncated the average completion
time schedule and started the makespan schedule on the
remaining jobs. By considering several di#erent break
points simultaneously, and taking the best one, Stein
and Wein show, via a complicated case analysis, how to
achieve improved approximations. In particular, they
prove the existence of (2, 1.735)­schedules, (1.785, 2)­
schedules and (1.88, 1.88)­schedules.
