Abstract. This paper describes an application of case-based reasoning in the field of health care
planning. The process is modelled in the FLORENCE expert system, an experimental prototype
which models the reasoning of an expert clinician in advising on the three basic planning tasks of
diagnosis, prognosis and prescription within a nursing domain. We have developed an empirical
approach. Both role-based and caae-based reasoning are used where appropriate. It has been found
that caae-based reasoning is especially appropriate to Situations where decisions must be made about
the progress of cases over time.
