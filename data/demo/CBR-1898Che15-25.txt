Abstract. A case-based reasoning system can produce both a solution and
an estimate of the confidence in that solution. The confidence value can be
used to determine whether the solution does or does not have the needed
accuracy. A statistical method can be used to compute a confidence value
from information generated during the case-based reasoning process. This
confidence value allows users to know when the results of the system
should and should not be used.
