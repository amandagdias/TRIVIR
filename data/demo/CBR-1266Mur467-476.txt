Abstract. Learning can be viewed as a problem of planning a series of
modifications to memory. We adopt this view of learning and propose
the applicability of the case-based planning methodology to the task of
planning to learn. We argue that relatively simple, fine-grained primitive
inferential operators are needed to support flexible planning. We show
that it is possible to obtain the benefits of case-based reasoning within
a planning to learn framework.
