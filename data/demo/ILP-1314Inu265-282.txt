Abstract. We propose an ILP system FOIL-I, which induces logic programs 
by a top-down method from incomplete samples. An incomplete
sample is constituted by some of positive examples and negative examples 
on a finite domain. FOIL-I has an evaluation function to estimate 
candidate definitions, the function which is composition of an
information-based function and an encoding complexity measure. FOILI 
uses a best-first search using the evaluation function to make use of
suspicious but necessary candidates. Other particular points include a
treatment for recursive definitions and removal of redundant clauses.
Randomly selected incomplete samples are tested with FOIL-I, Quinlan’s 
FOIL and Muggleton’s Progol. Compared with others FOIL-I can
induce target relations in many cases from small incomplete samples.
