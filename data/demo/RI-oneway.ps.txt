Abstract
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user
to read information from a database without revealing to
the server storing the database which information he has
read. Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky [23] construct, based on the
quadratic residuosity assumption, a single­server PIR proto­col 
with small communication complexity. Cachin, Micali,
and Stadler [5] present a single­server PIR protocol with a
smaller communication complexity, based on the (new) \Phi­
hiding assumption.
A major question, addressed in the present work, is what
assumption is the minimal assumption necessary for the con­struction 
of single­server private information retrieval pro­tocols 
with small communication complexity. We prove that
if there is a (0­error) PIR protocol in which the server sends
less than n bits then one­way functions exist (where n is the
number of bits in the database). That is, even saving one bit
compared to the naive protocol, in which the entire database
is sent, already requires one­way functions. The same result
holds (but requires more work) even if we allow the retrieval
to fail with probability of at most 1=(8n). Moreover, similar
results hold even if we allow constant probability of error.
For example, we prove that if there is a PIR protocol with er­
ror 1=4 and communication complexity less than n=10 bits,
then one­way functions exist.
