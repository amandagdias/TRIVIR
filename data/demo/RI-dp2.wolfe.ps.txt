Abstract
This study examines the hypothesis that the ability of a reader to learn
from text depends on the match between the background knowledge of
the reader and the difficulty of the text information. Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA), a statistical technique that represents the content of a
document as a vector in high dimensional semantic space based on a
large text corpus, is used to predict how much readers will learn from
texts based on the estimated conceptual match between their topic
knowledge and the text information. Participants completed tests to
assess their knowledge of the human heart and circulatory system,
then read one of four texts that ranged in difficulty from elementary to
medical school level, then completed the tests again. Results show a
non­monotonic relationship in which learning was greatest for texts
that were neither too easy nor too difficult. LSA proved as effective at
predicting learning from these texts as traditional knowledge
assessment measures. For these texts, optimal assignment of text on the
basis of either pre­reading measure would have increased the amount
learned significantly.
