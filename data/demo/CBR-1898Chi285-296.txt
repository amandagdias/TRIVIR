Abstract This paper proposes a methodology of maintaining Case
Based Reasoning (CBR) systems by using fuzzy decision tree
induction - a machine learning technique. The methodology is mainly
based on the idea that a large case library can be transformed to a small
case library together with a group of adaptation rules which are
generated by fuzzy decision trees. Firstly, an approach to learning
feature weights automatically is used to evaluate the importance of
different features in a given case-base. Secondly, clustering of cases
will be carried out to identify different concepts in the case-base using
the acquired feature knowledge. Thirdly, adaptation rules will be mined
for each concept using fuzzy decision trees. Finally, a selection strategy
based on the concepts of e -coverage and e -reachability is used to
select representative cases. The effectiveness of the method is
demonstrated experimentally using two sets of testing data.
