Abstract. In this paper we investigate a new language for learning,
which combines two well-known representation formalisms, Description
Logics and Horn Clause Logics. Our goal is to study the feasability of
learning in such a hybrid description - horn clause language, namely
CARIN-ALN [LR98b] , in the presence of hybrid background knowledge,
including a Horn clause and a terminological component. After setting
our learning framework, we present algorithms for testing example coverage 
and subsumption between two hypotheses, based on the existential
entailment algorithm studied in[LR98b]. While the hybrid language is
more expressive than horn clause logics alone, the complexity of these
two steps for CARIN-ALN remains bounded by their respective complexity 
in horn clause logics.
