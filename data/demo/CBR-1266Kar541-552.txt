Abstract. The integration of classical case-based reasoning with other
problem solving methods attracts increasing research interest in the
broader area of information and decision support systems. This paper
presents a framework where CBR and Argumentation Based Reasoning
jointly aid agents to address various discourse instances in group decision
making processes. The ability to comprehend and engage in arguments
is essential for these environments, while use of precedent cases is well-suited. 
Cases in our model are not merely considered as representations
of past data, but as flexible entities associated with the underlying view-point 
of an agent and the evolution of the corresponding discussion. The
paper provides an object-oriented description of the elements involved,
and illustrates their dependencies through a comprehensive example.
