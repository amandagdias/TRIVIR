Abstract
Semantic knowledge can be a great asset to
natural language processing systems, but
it is usually hand­coded for each applica­tion. 
Although some semantic information
is available in general­purpose knowledge
bases such as WordNet and Cyc, many ap­plications 
require domain­specific lexicons
that represent words and categories for a
particular topic. In this paper, we present
a corpus­based method that can be used
to build semantic lexicons for specific categories. 
The input to the system is a small
set of seed words for a category and a rep­resentative 
text corpus. The output is a
ranked list of words that are associated
with the category. A user then reviews the
top­ranked words and decides which ones
should be entered in the semantic lexicon.
In experiments with five categories, users
typically found about 60 words per cate­gory 
in 10­15 minutes to build a core se­mantic lexicon.
