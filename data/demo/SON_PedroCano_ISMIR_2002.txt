ABSTRACT
In this article, a heuristic version of Multidimensional Scaling
(MDS) named is used for audio retrieval and browsing.  ysis (PCA) is proposed.
like MDS, maps objects into an Euclideanspace, such
that similarities are preserved. In additionof being more eficient
than MDS it allows query­by­example type of query, which makes      
it suitable for a content­based retrieval purposes.               
is proposed to address this issue.
