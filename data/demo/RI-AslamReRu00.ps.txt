Abstract
We present three scalable extensions of the star algorithm for information organization that use
sampling. The star algorithm organizes a document collection into clusters that are naturally induced
by the topic structure of collection, via a computationally efficient cover by dense subgraphs. We
also provide supporting data from extensive experiments.
