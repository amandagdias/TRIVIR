Abstract. In this paper, we consider learning first-order Horn programs
from entailment. In particular, we show that any subclass of first-order
acyclic Horn programs with constant arity is exactly learnable from
equivalence and entailment membership queries provided it allows a
polynomial-time subsumption procedure and satisfies some closure conditions. 
One consequence of this is that first-order acyclic determinate
Horn programs with constant arity are exactly learnable from equivalence 
and entailment membership queries.
