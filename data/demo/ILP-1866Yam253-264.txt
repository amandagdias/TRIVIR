Abstract. Least common generalization under relative subsumption
(LGRS) is a fundamental concept in Inductive Logic Programming. In
this paper we give several new conditions for the existence of LGRSs.
In previous researches the existence of LGRSs was guaranteed when a
background theory is logically equivalent to conjunction of finitely many
ground literals. Each of our conditions allows a background theory to
have clauses with variables in it. The conditions are obtained using the
bottom method (or the bottom generalization method), with which any
clause subsuming a positive example relative to a background theory can
be derived. We also compare the conditions with those for the existence
of relative least generalizations under generalized subsumption (LGGSs) .
