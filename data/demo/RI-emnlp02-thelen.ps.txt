Abstract
This paper describes a bootstrapping al­gorithm called Basilisk that learns high­
quality semantic lexicons for multiple cate­gories. Basilisk begins with an unannotated
corpus and seed words for each semantic
category, which are then bootstrapped to
learn new words for each category. Basilisk
hypothesizes the semantic class of a word
based on collective information over a large
body of extraction pattern contexts. We
evaluate Basilisk on six semantic categories.
The semantic lexicons produced by Basilisk
have higher precision than those produced
by previous techniques, with several cate­gories showing substantial improvement.
