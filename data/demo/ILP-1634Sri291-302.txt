Abstract. The Predictive Toxicology Evaluation (or PTE) Challenge
provided Machine Learning techniques with the opportunity to compete
against specialised techniques for toxicology prediction. Toxicity models
that used findings from ILP programs have performed creditably in the
PTE-2 experiment proposed under this challenge. We report here on an
assessment of such models along scales of: (1) quantitative performance,
in comparison to models developed with expert collaboration; and (2)
potential explanatory value for toxicology. Results appear to suggest the
following: (a) across of range of class distributions and error costs, some
explicit models constructed with ILP-assistance appear closer to optimal 
than most expert-assisted ones. Given the paucity of test-data, this
is to be interpreted cautiously; (b) a combined use of propositional and
ILP techniques appears to yield models that contain unusual combinations 
of structural and biological features; and (c) significant effort was
required to interpret the output, strongly indicating the need to invest
greater effort in transforming the output into a “toxicologist-friendly”
form. Based on the lessons learnt from these results, we propose a new
predictive toxicology evaluation experiment — PTE-3 — which will address
some important shortcomings of the previous study.
