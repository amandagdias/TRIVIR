Abstract
Many tools for debugging parallel programs offer valuable
informati onto programmers but workin only a limited 
range of situations. For example, they may help a                                                     
programmer detect a specific class of program errors, or                                                       
they may work on just one parallel machine. A broadly                                                     
useful debugger should offer several views of a program's                                                      
behavior, and it should work equally well on many paallel 
architectures. Furthermore, the user should be able                                                   
to design and install new program views that match the                                                     
structure of a particular program. In this paper we describe 
Panorama, a parallel debugger that should offer
these benefits. Panorama offers the programmer multiple                                                        
views of the program's behavior, andit includes a simple
logging and replay facility that allows parallel programs                                                  
be debugged either on-line or ost-mortem.
