ABSTRACT
This paper will describe the approach of modeling and sonifying   
the interaction with a pen on surfaces. The main acoustic parts   
and the dynamic behavior of the interaction are identified and a       
synthesis model is proposed to imitate the sound emanation        
during typical interactions on surfaces. Ahouglth a surace ifs
dimensional, modeling acoustical qualities of surfaces has to          
employ volumes to form resonances. Specific qualities of surfaces 
like the roughness and the texture are imitated by a noise        
generator which is controlled by the pen movement in real-time         
to achieve a maximum of acceptance of thound ee s  ffect. The     
effect will be used one hand to produce natural and coherent      
interaction on nearly silent electronic white boards or pen-tablets,   
i.e., reinventing of lost sound qualities. On the other hand      
modeling and sonifying pen strokes on surfaces allow to convey    
information about the properties of different areas or the current     
state of a windows of a computer display by using this sound      
feedback.
