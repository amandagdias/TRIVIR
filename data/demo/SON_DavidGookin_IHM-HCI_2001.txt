SUMMARY
In this paper we describe a new focus and context visualization
technique called multimodal focus and context.   
This technique uses a hybrid visual and spatialized audio  
display space to overcome the limited visual displays of   
mobile devices.  We demonstrate the technique by applying 
it to maps of theme parks.
