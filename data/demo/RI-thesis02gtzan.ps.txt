Abstract
Digital audio and especially music collections are becoming a major part of the average
computer user experience. Large digital audio collections of sound effects are also used by
the movie and animation industry. Research areas that utilize large audio collections in­
clude: Auditory Display, Bioacoustics, Computer Music, Forensics, and Music Cognition.
In order to develop more sophisticated tools for interacting with large digital audio
collections, research in Computer Audition algorithms and user interfaces is required.
In this work a series of systems for manipulating, retrieving from, and analysing large
collections of audio signals will be described. The foundation of these systems is the design
of new and the application of existing algorithms for automatic audio content analysis. The
results of the analysis are used to build novel 2D and 3D graphical user interfaces for
browsing and interacting with audio signals and collections. The proposed systems are
based on techniques from the fields of Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition, Information
Retrieval, Visualization and Human Computer Interaction. All the proposed algorithms and
interfaces are integrated under MARSYAS, a free software framework designed for rapid
prototyping of computer audition research. In most cases the proposed algorithms have
been evaluated and informed by conducting user studies.
New contributions of this work to the area of Computer Audition include: a gen­eral 
multifeature audio texture segmentation methodology, feature extraction from mp3
compressed data, automatic beat detection and analysis based on the Discrete Wavelet
Transform and musical genre classification combining timbral, rhythmic and harmonic
features. Novel graphical user interfaces developed in this work are various tools for
browsing and visualizing large audio collections such as the Timbregram, TimbreSpace,
GenreGram, and Enhanced Sound Editor.
