ABSTRACT                                                                            
In this paper we report on an ongoing investigation into the    
relationship between musical structure and hyperstructure, based
on a series of open hypermedia systems research projects that   
have featured case studies involving musical content. We provide
a general overview of the intersection between hypermedia and   
musical structure, drawing also on ideas from narrative structure.
Through the example systems we consider techniques for          
building hyperstructure from musical structure and, conversely, 
building musical structure from hyperstructure.  Additionally we                    
describe an experiment in the sonification of hyperstructure.
