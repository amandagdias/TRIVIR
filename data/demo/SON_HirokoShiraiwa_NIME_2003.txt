ABSTRACT                                                 
This paper presents a novel use of a chemical experiments 
framework as a control layer and sound source in a concert 
situation. Signal uctuations from electrolytic batteries 
made out of household chemicals, and acoustic samples 
obtained from an acid/base reaction are used for musical                                                               
purposes beyond the standard data sonication role. The    
batteries are controlled in h andy ways such as warming,  
stirring and pouring that are also visually engaging. Audio   
mappings include synthetic and sampled sounds completing                                                               
a recipet hat con cocts a live performance of computer music.
