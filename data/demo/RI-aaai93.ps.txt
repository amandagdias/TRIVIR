Abstract
Knowledge­based natural language processing systems have
achieved good success with certain tasks but they are of­
ten criticized because they depend on a domain­ specific
dictionary that requires a great deal of manual knowledge
engineering. This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes
knowledge­based NLP systems impractical for real ­world
applications because they cannot be easily scaled up or ported
to new domains. In response to this problem, we devel­
oped a system called AutoSlog that automatically builds a
domain ­specific dictionary of concepts for extracting infor­mation 
from text. Using AutoSlog, we constructed a dictio­nary 
for the domain of terrorist event descriptions in only 5
person­hours. We then compared the AutoSlog dictionary
with a hand­crafted dictionary that was built by two highly
skilled graduate students and required approximately 1500
person­hours of effort. We evaluated the two dictionaries
using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the
AutoSlog dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of
the hand­crafted dictionary. On the first test set, the Auto­
Slog dictionary obtained 96.3% of the performance of the
hand­crafted dictionary. On the second test set, the over­all 
scores were virtually indistinguishable with the AutoSlog
dictionary achieving 99.7% of the performance of the hand­crafted 
dictionary.
