ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results from a qualitative case study 
of an auditory version of the game Towers of Hanoi. The goal  
of this study was to explore qualitative aspects of auditory  
direct manipulation and the subjective experience from playing 
the game. The results show that it is important to provide
a way of focusing in the auditory space. Articulatory directness 
was also an important issue and feedback should support 
the movement of the objects in the auditory space.
