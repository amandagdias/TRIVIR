Abstract. We discuss several problems of analogy-driven proof plan
construction which prevent a solution for more difficult target problems
or make a solution very expensive. Some of these problems are due to the
previously assumed fixed order of matching, reformulation, and replay in
case-based reasoning and from a too restricted combination of planning
from first principles with the analogy process. In order to overcome these
problems we suggest to interleave matching and replay as well as case-based 
planning with planning from first principles.
Secondly, the restricted mixture of case-based planning and planning
from first principles in previous systems is generalised to intelligently
employing different planning strategies with the objective to solve more
problems at all and to solve problems more efficiently.
