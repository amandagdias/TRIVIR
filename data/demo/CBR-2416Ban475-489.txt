Abstract. This paper illustrates how the Case Based Reasoning (CBR)
paradigm has been applied to the definition of the requirements and the
specifications of a Knowledge Management technology supporting the
handling of tuning and anomalies in production processes. In particular,
the production of truck tyres will be illustrated as the application domain
of the proposed approach. This domain is a paradigmatic example where
the valorization of the experiential knowledge is a company requirement,
so the representation of knowledge concerning production process issues
is mandatory. It requires extending CBR techniques to an emerging area
of application involving knowledge about the interplay of static objects
(i.e. products) with dynamic objects (i.e. processes). The content of production 
cases, their organization into a Case Base and a first proposal
for the Case Base retrieval of similar cases will be presented.
