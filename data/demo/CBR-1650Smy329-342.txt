Abstract. Case-based reasoning systems solve problems by reusing a corpus of
previous problem solving experience stored as a case-base of individual
problem solving cases. In this paper we describe a new technique for
constructing compact competent case-bases. The technique is novel in its use of
an explicit model of case competence. This allows cases to be selected on the
basis of their individual competence contributions. An experimental study
shows how this technique compares favorably to more traditional strategies
across a range of standard data-sets.
