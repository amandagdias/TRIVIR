ABSTRACT
The field of information retrieval has traditionally focused on
textbases consisting of titles and abstracts. As a consequence,
many underlying assumptions must be altered for retrieval
from full­length text collections. This paper argues for mak­ing 
use of text structure when retrieving from full text doc­uments, 
and presents a visualization paradigm, called Tile­
Bars, that demonstrates the usefulness of explicit term distri­bution 
information in Boolean­type queries. TileBars simul­
taneously and compactly indicate relative document length,
query term frequency, and query term distribution. The pat­terns 
in a column of TileBars can be quickly scanned and de­
ciphered, aiding users in making judgments about the poten­tial 
relevance of the retrieved documents.
