Abstract
Information extraction (IE) systems are costly to
build because they require development texts, pars­ing 
tools, and specialized dictionaries for each ap­plication 
domain and each natural language that
needs to be processed. We present a novel
method for rapidly creating IE systems for new lan­guages
 by exploiting existing IE systems via cross­
language projection. Given an IE system for a
source language (e.g., English), we can transfer its
annotations to corresponding texts in a target lan­guage 
(e.g., French) and learn information extrac­
tion rules for the new language automatically. In
this paper, we explore several ways of realizing both
the transfer and learning processes using off­-the-shelf 
machine translation systems, induced word
alignment, attribute projection, and transformation­
based learning. We present a variety of experiments
that show how an English IE system for a plane
crash domain can be leveraged to automatically cre­ate 
 French IE system for the same domain.
