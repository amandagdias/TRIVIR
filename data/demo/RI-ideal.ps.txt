Abstract
Given a set of parties f1; : : : ; ng, an access structure is a monotone collection of subsets of
the parties. For a certain domain of secrets, a secret sharing scheme for an access structure
is a method for a dealer to distribute shares to the parties. These shares enable subsets
in the access structure to reconstruct the secret, while subsets not in the access structure
get no information about the secret. A secret sharing scheme is ideal if the domains of the
shares are the same as the domain of the secrets. An access structure is universally ideal
if there exists an ideal secret sharing scheme for it over every finite domain of secrets. An
obvious necessary condition for an access structure to be universally ideal is to be ideal
over the binary and ternary domains of secrets. In this work, we prove that this condition
is also sufficient. We also show that being ideal over just one of the two domains does not
suffice for universally ideal access structures. Finally, we give an exact characterization for
each of these two conditions.
