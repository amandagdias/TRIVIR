Abstract. Design is a complex open-ended task and it is unreasonable to expect a
case-base to contain representatives of all possible designs. Therefore, adaptation
is a desirable capability for case-based design systems, but acquiring adaptation
knowledge can involve significant effort. In this paper adaptation knowledge is
induced separately for different criteria associated with the retrieved solution, using 
knowledge sources implicit in the case-base. This provides a committee of
learners and their combined advice is better able to satisfy design constraints and
compatibility requirements compared to a single learner. The main emphasis of the
paper is to evaluate the impact of specific-to-general and general-to-specific learning 
on adaptation knowledge acquired by committee members. For this purpose
we conduct experiments on a real tablet formulation problem which is tackled as
a decomposable design task. Evaluation results suggest that adaptation achieves
significant gains compared to a retrieve-only CBR system, but shows that both
learning biases can be beneficial for different decomposed sub-tasks.
