Abstract. Most of machine learning is concerned with learning a single 
concept from a sequence of examples. In repeat learning the teacher
chooses a series of related concepts randomly and independently from a
distribution D A finite sequence of examples is provided for each concept 
in the series. The learner does not initially know V, but progressively
updates a posterior estimation of V as the series progresses. This paper
considers predicate invention within Inductive Logic Programming as a
mechanism for updating the learner’s estimation of V. A new predicate
invention mechanism implemented in Progol4.4 is used in repeat learning
experiments within a chess domain. The results indicate that significant
performance increases can be achieved. The paper develops a Bayesian
framework and demonstrates initial theoretical results for repeat learning.
