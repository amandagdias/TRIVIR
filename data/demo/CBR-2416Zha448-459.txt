Abstract. Increasing diversity for case-based reasoning (CBR) is an issue that
has recently drawn the attention of researchers in the CBR field. Several
diversification techniques have been proposed and discussed in the literature.
However, whether and to what extent those techniques can bring about benefits
to end-users remains in question. In this paper, we report an experiment in
applying a diversification technique to a case-based diagnosis tool in a product
maintenance domain. The results of this offer some evidence in support of
diversification techniques.
