ABSTRACT
A method is proposed for parametric motion estimation
of an image region. It is assumed that the region consid­ered 
undergoes an affine transformation, which means
that the motion is composed of a translation and a pure
affine function of pixel coordinates. The solution of the
object correspondence problem is assumed to be known.
The estimation of the six motion parameters is based on
the moments of the corresponding image regions. Mo­ments 
up to order three are needed. For the motion
computation each region is transformed to a standard
position which is defined using affine invariants. The
result of motion estimation is checked in the construc­tion 
of a mosaic image.
