ABSTRACT
Advances in digital storage technology and the wide use of digital audio compression standards like MPEG have made possible
the creation of large archives of audio material. In order to work efficiently with these large archives much more structure
than what is currently available is needed. The creation of the necessary text indices is difficult to fully automate. However,
significant amounts of user time can be saved by having the computer assist the user during the annotation process.
In this paper, we describe a prototype audio browsing tool that was used to perform user experiments in semi­automatic audio
segmentation annotation. In addition to the typical sound­editor functionality the system can automatically suggest time lines
that the user can edit and annotate. We examine the effect that this automatically suggested segmentation has on the user
decisions as well as timing information about segmentation and annotation. Finally we discuss thumbnailing and semantic
labeling of annotated audio.
