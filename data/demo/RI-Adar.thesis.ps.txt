Abstract
Given today's tangle of digital information, one of the hardest tasks for information
systems users is finding anything in the mess. For a number of well documented
reasons including the amazing growth in the Internet's popularity and the drop in
the cost of storage, the amount of information on the net, as well as on a user's local
computer has increased dramatically in recent years. Although this readily available
information should be extremely beneficial for computer users, paradoxically it is now
much harder to find anything.
Many different solutions have been proposed to the general information seeking
task of users, but few if any have addressed the needs of individuals or have leveraged
the benefit of single­user interaction. The Haystack project is an attempt to answer
the needs of the individual user. Creating such a system requires solving two problems.
Half the problem addresses the manipulation of the data into a queryable format.
Once the user's information is represented in Haystack, the other half of the problem
centers around our desire to answer the highly varied questions a user may ask about
this information. In this thesis we will propose a means of representing information
in a robust model within Haystack and we will describe a corresponding mechanism
by which the diverse questions of the individual can be answered. This novel method
functions by using a combination of existing information systems. We will call this
combined system a hybrid­search system.
