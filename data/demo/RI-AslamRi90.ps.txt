Abstract
We consider the problem of inferring an undirected, degree­bounded, edge­colored
graph from the sequence of edge colors seen in a walk of that graph. This problem can
be viewed as reconstructing the structure of a Markov chain from its output. (That is,
we are not concerned with inferring the transition probabilities, but only the underlying
graph structure of the Markov chain.) We present polynomial­time algorithms for the
inference of underlying graphs of degree­bound 2 (linear chains and cycles), based on
some surprising properties about the confluence of various sets of rewrite rules.
