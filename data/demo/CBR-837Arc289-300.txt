Abstract. In this paper we will discuss the role of case-based reasoning and
learning as a tool for integrating different methods of inference and different
methods of learning. The Massive Memory Architecture, an experimental
framework for experience-based learning and reasoning, is described. Its
reflective capabilities are described and we put forth the hypothesis that learning
methods are inference methods able to inspect the problem solving process and
modify the system itself so as to improve its behavior. Therefore, learning
methods require a self-model of the system. Self-models and method
implementation are based on conceptual, knowledge-level descriptions of
inference.
