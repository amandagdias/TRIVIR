ABSTRACT
Given the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple
search engines in response to a given query, the problem of
metasearch is to combine these lists in a way which optimizes
the performance of the combination. This paper makes three
contributions to the problem of metasearch: (1) We describe
and investigate a metasearch model based on an optimal
democratic voting procedure, the Borda Count; (2) we de­
scribe and investigate a metasearch model based on Bayesian
inference; and (3) we describe and investigate a model for
obtaining upper bounds on the performance of metasearch
algorithms. Our experimental results show that metasearch
algorithms based on the Borda and Bayesian models usu­ally 
outperform the best input system and are competitive
with, and often outperform, existing metasearch strategies.
Finally, our initial upper bounds demonstrate that there is
much to learn about the limits of the performance of meta­
search.
