ABSTRACT
Soboro#, Nicholas and Cahan recently proposed a method
for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems without
relevance judgments. They demonstrated that the system
evaluations produced by their methodology are correlated
with actual evaluations using relevance judgments in the
TREC competition. In this work, we propose an explana­tion 
for this phenomenon. We devise a simple measure for
quantifying the similarity of retrieval systems by assessing
the similarity of their retrieved results. Then, given a collec­tion 
of retrieval systems and their retrieved results, we use
this measure to assess the average similarity of a system to
the other systems in the collection. We demonstrate that
evaluating retrieval systems according to average similarity
yields results quite similar to the methodology proposed by
Soboro# et al., and we further demonstrate that these two
techniques are in fact highly correlated. Thus, the tech­niques 
are effectively evaluating and ranking retrieval sys­tems 
by ``popularity'' as opposed to ``performance.''
