Abstract. We introduce an application combining CBR and collaborative 
filtering techniques in the music domain. We describe a scenario
in which a new kind of recommendation is required, which is capable
of summarizing many recommendations in one suggestion. Our claim is
that recommending one set of goods is different from recommending a
single good many times. The paper illustrates how a case-based reasoning 
approach can provide an effective solution to this problem reducing
the drawbacks related to the user profiles. CoCoA, a compilation compiler 
advisor, will be described as a running example of a collaborative
case-based recommendation system.
