ABSTRACT
There is a huge amount of audio data available that is
compressed using the MPEG audio compression standard.
Sound analysis is based on the computation of short time
feature vectors that describe the instantaneous spectral con­tent 
of the sound. An interesting possibility is the calcu­lation 
of features during the decompression process. Since
the bulk of the feature calculation is performed during the
encoding stage this process has a significant performance
advantage if the available data is compressed. Combining
decoding and analysis in one stage is also very important
for audio streaming applications.
In this paper, we describe the calculation of features
directly from MPEG audio compressed data. Two of the
basic processes of analyzing sound are: segmentation and
classification. To illustrate the effectiveness of the calcu­lated 
features we have implemented two case studies: a
general audio segmentation algorithm and a Music/Speech
classifier . Experimental data is provided to show that the
results obtained are comparable with sound analysis algo­rithms 
working directly with audio samples.
