SCAN YOUR LIFE:
Integrating OCR into your Personal Haystack!

Adam Holt
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

Abstract
I built a self-serve OCR station where anybody can scan in documents at high-speed
{ a public yet private ATM that accepts document deposits of a wider assortment
than just checks. Depending on whether you scan a business card, an article or your
entireling cabinet, CPU-intensive recognition continues after you leave the station,
and you are emailed options for secure web pickup. Users of MIT's Haystack personal
repositories can even do \1-click" merging of oine literary artifacts into their online
lives.
The paperless pipe dream may never happen, but cheap digital optics and a mundane 
40-year old technology (OCR) are converging to change the game. The mindless
convenience of my $6000 kiosk suggests OCR will become a regulated munition* in
the coming intellectual property and privacy wars. As OCR proliferates into cheap
PDA's, neither publisher nor individual may ever again rely on humanity's oldest
form of copy protection: paper.
