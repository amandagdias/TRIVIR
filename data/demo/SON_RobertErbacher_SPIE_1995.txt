Abstract                                             
We discuss the integration of          visualization and      supercomputing in a low cost     
environment. Computational requirements continue to increase dramatically as                   
computational capabilities do. Yet most architectures still separate both processes. The       
computation is done on one system and the visualization on another. We describe an             
innovative architecture developed by the Supercomputer Research Center of the Institute        
for Defense Analysis within which the integration of visualization and                         
supercomputation is realized. Immediate gains are obvious: program visualization,              
real-time computational steering, and rapid porting of current applications. We                
describe the issues in porting our experimental visualization          software1,2,7 and issues
e encountered. We describe limitations and advantages of the hardware/software                
coupling. We also discuss a proposed extension of that architecture.
