ABSTRACT
Recent work has demonstrated that the assessment of pair­
wise object similarity can be approached in an axiomatic
manner using information theory. We extend this concept
specifically to document similarity and test the effective­
ness of an information­theoretic measure for pairwise docu­
ment similarity. We adapt query retrieval to rate the quality
of document similarity measures and demonstrate that our
proposed information­theoretic measure for document simi­larity 
yields statistically significant improvements over other
popular measures of similarity.
