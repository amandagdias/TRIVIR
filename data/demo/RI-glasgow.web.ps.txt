Abstract
The aim of our participation in the topic distillation and the named page finding tasks of the
Web track is the evaluation of a well­founded modular probabilistic framework for Web Information
Retrieval, which integrates content and link analyses. The link analysis component of the framework
employs a new probabilistic approach, called the Absorbing Model, for calculating a measure of
popularity for documents induced from the Web graph.
