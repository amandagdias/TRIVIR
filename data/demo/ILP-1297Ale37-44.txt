Abstract. Current speech recognition systems can be categorized into
two broad classes; the knowledge-based approach and the stochastic one.
In this paper we present a rule-based method for the recognition of Hungarian 
vowels. A spectrogram model was used as a front-end module
and some acoustic features were extracted (e.g. locations, intensities and
shapes of local maxima) from spectrograms by using a genetic algorithm
method. On the basis of these features we developed a rule set for the
recognition of isolated Hungarian vowels. These rules represented by Prolog 
clauses were refined by the IMPUT Inductive Logic Programming
method.
