Abstract. In this paper we present an algorithm called DerUCP, which
can be regarded as a general model for plan adaptation using Derivational 
Analogy. Using DerUCP, we show that previous results on the
complexity of plan adaptation do not apply to Derivational Analogy. We
also show that Derivational Analogy can potentially produce exponential 
reductions in the size of the search space generated by a planning
system.
