Abstract. This paper describes an innovative application of Case-Based
Reasoning methodologies for the dynamic management of wireless
telecommunications systems. In spite of the very dynamic nature of mobile
communications, wireless networks only possess limited adaptive management
capabilities, which are unable to adequately follow traffic fluctuations through
flexible and real-time resource assignment reconfigurations. The study
described in this paper is an attempt to improve over these limitations, by
allowing wireless networks to alleviate the effects of traffic overloads through
an automated reasoning about its performance levels and an on-the-fly
reconfiguration of resources assignment. The proposed Case-Based Reasoning
approach provides a suitable framework to define a simple and scalable solution
that easily incorporates the preferences of the network operators.
