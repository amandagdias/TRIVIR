Abstract. The use of CBR has been very profitable for many areas of
artificial intelligence. Applying CBR to automated deduction, however,
is a very intricate problem. The premise “small changes of a problem
cause small changes of its solution” is definitely not satisfied by automated 
deduction. Therefore, case adaptation by means of symbolic proof
transformation techniques is very limited.
In view of the fact that automated deduction essentially is a search problem, 
we propose to utilize case adaptation for selecting and configuring
a search-guiding heuristic based on known cases. This also allows us to
elegantly integrate methods for learning search-guiding heuristics which
can significantly improve performance. The evaluation step of CBR corresponds 
to an attempt of the theorem prover at hand to solve a problem 
employing the heuristic provided by case adaptation. Experimental
studies demonstrated that this approach is viable and actually produces
promising results.
