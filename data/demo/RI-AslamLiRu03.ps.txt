Abstract
This paper discusses online power­aware routing in large wireless ad­hoc networks (es­pecially 
sensor networks) for applications where the message sequence is not known. We
seek to optimize the lifetime of the network. We show that online power­aware routing
does not have a constant competitive ratio to the o#­line optimal algorithm. We develop
an approximation algorithm called max­min zPmin that has a good empirical competitive
ratio. To ensure scalability, we introduce a second online algorithm for power­aware rout­ing. 
This hierarchical algorithm is called zone­based routing. Our experiments show that
its performance is quite good. Finally, we describe a distributed version of this algorithm
that does not depend on any centralization.
