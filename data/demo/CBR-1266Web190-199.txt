Abstract. In this paper we propose a large case-based reasoner for the legal domain.
Analyzing legal texts for indexing purposes makes the implementation of large case
bases a complex task. We present a methodology to automatically convert legal texts
into legal cases guided by domain expert knowledge in a rule-based system with
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This methodology can be generalized
to be applied in different domains making Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) paradigm a
powerful technology to solve real world problems with large knowledge sources.
