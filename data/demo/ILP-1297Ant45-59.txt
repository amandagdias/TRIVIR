Abstract. Many top-down Inductive Logic Programming systems use a
greedy, covering approach to construct hypotheses. This paper presents
an alternative, cautious approach, known as cautious induction. We conjecture 
that cautious induction can allow better hypotheses to be found,
with respect to some hypothesis quality criteria. This conjecture is supported 
by the presentation of an algorithm called CILS, and with a complexity 
analysis and empirical comparison of CILS with the Progol system. 
The results are encouraging and demonstrate the applicability of
cautious induction to problems with noisy datasets, and to problems
which require large, complex hypotheses to be learnt.
