Abstract. Case-based reasoning involves reasoning from cases: specific
pieces of experience, the reasoner’s or another’s, that can be used to
solve problems. We use the term “graph-structured” for representations
that (1) are capable of expressing the relations between any two objects
in a case, (2) allow the set of relations used to vary from case to case
and (3) allow the set of possible relations to be expanded as necessary
to describe new cases. Such representations can be implemented as, for
example, semantic networks or lists of concrete propositions in some
logic.
We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, 
and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations 
efficiently. We make a “case-based argument” using examples from
two systems, CHIRON and CAPER, to show how a graph-structured representation 
supports two different kinds of case-based planning in two
different domains. We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured
representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, implemented
in CAPER.
