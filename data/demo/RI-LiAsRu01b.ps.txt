ABSTRACT
This paper discusses online power­aware routing in large
wireless ad­hoc networks for applications where the message
sequence is not known. We seek to optimize the lifetime of
the network. We show that online power­aware routing does
not have a constant competitive ratio to the offline optimal
algorithm. We develop an approximation algorithm called
max­min zPmin that has a good empirical competitive ra­tio. 
To ensure scalability, we introduce a second online algo­
rithm for power­aware routing. This hierarchical algorithm
is called zone­based routing. Our experiments show that its
performance is quite good.
