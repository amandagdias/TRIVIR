Abstract. This paper describes a technique for integrating case-based
reasoning with model-based reasoning to predict the behavior of biological 
systems characterized both by incomplete models and insufficient
empirical data for accurate induction. This technique is implemented in
GARMA, a system for rangeland pest management advising. CARMA’s
ability to predict the forage consumption judgments of 15 expert entomologists 
was empirically compared to that of CARMA’s case-based and
model-based components in isolation. This evaluation confirmed the hypothesis 
that integrating model-based and case-based reasoning through
model-based adaptation can lead to more accurate predictions than the
use of either technique individually.
