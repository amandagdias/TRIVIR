Abstract

The design architecture, case representation of actual medical cases, and the implementation of
TROPIX, a tropical disease diagnosis and therapy tool are presented. TROPIX is intended to be
bundled with laptop computers for rural health centers and semi-urban hospitals in developing
countries. Our model uses the ideal domain knowledge to build a decision matrix, DM from
disease features against which new cases are measured using the MVF (Matched Vector
Functions) algorithms. The result of the diagnosis stage provided by the MVF procedure and
other parameters of the features are then used for CBR case retrievals, verification, and case
validation. The final stage in the design yields the selection of 1 or 2 competing cases presented
for reuse and perhaps for subsequent repair and adaptation.
The solution for the new case solved is either one or more actions, a therapy plan or
recommendations. The design demonstrates how we can integrate domain knowledge and
(medical) records with CBR, statistical pattern recognition, and abductive reasoning to build a
knowledge based system.
