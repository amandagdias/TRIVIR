Abstract. We present the learning system MACCENT which addresses
the novel task of stochastic MAximum ENTropy modeling with Clausal
Constraints. Maximum Entropy method is a Bayesian method based on
the principle that the target stochastic model should be as uniform as
possible, subject to known constraints. MACCENT incorporates clausal
constraints that are based on the evaluation of Prolog clauses in examples 
represented as Prolog programs. We build on an existing maximum-likelihood 
approach to maximum entropy modeling, which we upgrade
along two dimensions: (1) MACCENT can handle larger search spaces,
due to a partial ordering defined on the space of clausal constraints, and
(2) uses a richer first-order logic format. In comparison with other inductive 
logic programming systems, MACCENT seems to be the first that
explicitly constructs a conditional probability distribution p(C|I) based
on an empirical distribution p’(C|I) (where p(C|I) (p’(C|I)) equals the
induced (observed) probability of an instance I belonging to a class C).
First experiments indicate MACCENT may be useful for prediction, and
for classification in cases where the induced model should be combined
with other stochastic information sources.
