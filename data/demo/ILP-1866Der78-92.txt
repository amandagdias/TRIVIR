Abstract. A novel query language for database mining, called RDM,
is presented. RDM provides primitives for discovering frequent patterns
and association rules, for manipulating example sets, for performing 
predictive and descriptive induction and for reasoning about the generality
of hypotheses. RDM is designed for querying deductive databases and
employs principles from inductive logic programming. Therefore RDM
allows to query patterns that involve multiple relations as well as 
background knowledge. The embedding of RDM within a programming 
language such as PROLOG puts database mining on similar grounds as
constraint programming. An operational semantics for RDM is outlined
and an efficient algorithm for solving RDM queries is presented. This
solver integrates Mitchell’s versionspace approach with the well-known
APRIORI algorithm by Agrawal et al.
