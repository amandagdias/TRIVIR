Abstract. Constructive adaptation is a search-based technique for generative 
reuse in CBR systems for configuration tasks. We discuss the
relation of constructive adaptation (CA) with other reuse approaches
and we define CA as a search process in the space of solutions where
cases are used in two main phases: hypotheses generation and hypotheses 
ordering. Later, three different CBR systems using CA for reuse are
analyzed: configuring gas treatment plants, generating expressive musical 
phrases, and configuring component-based software applications.
After the three analyses, constructive adaptation is discussed in detail
and some conclusions are drawn to close the paper.
