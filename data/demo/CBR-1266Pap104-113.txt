Abstract. This paper presents a case-based authoring system for training
and educational applications. The system, called Ocram-CBR and
developed in JAVATM, can plan lessons for any application domain
whatsoever. Ocram-CBR contains a User Modeling module, capable of
building a representation of the user objectives and characteristics, that
allows personalizing the teaching interaction. A distinguishing feature of
the User Modeling module is the use of a hybrid approach, in which case-based 
components and an artificial neural network are integrated into
one coherent system so that each component performs the tasks for which
it is best suited. The Training module of Ocram-CBR plans lessons using
a library of cases indexed and successively retrieved by means of a
discrimination search and serial search. The system has been adapted for
a training course in Information Systems” and for a second application
which will teach learners to write business letters more effectively.
