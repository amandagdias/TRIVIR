Abstract. A significant problem for case-based reasoning (CBR) systems is determining 
the features to use in judging case similarity for retrieval. We describe
research that addresses the feature selection problem by using introspective reasoning 
to learn new features for indexing. Our method augments the CBR system
with an introspective reasoning component which monitors system performance
to detect poor retrievals, identifies features which would lead retrieval of more
adaptable cases, and refines the indexing criteria to include the needed features
to avoid future failures. We explore the benefit of introspective reasoning by performing 
empirical tests on the implemented system. These tests examine the effect
of introspective index refinement, and the effects of problem order on case and index 
learning, and show that introspective learning of new index features improves
performance across the different problem orders.
