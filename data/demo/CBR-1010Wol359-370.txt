Abstract. If analogy and case-based reasoning systems are to scale up
to very large case bases, it is important to analyze the various methods 
used for retrieving analogues to identify the features of the problem
for which they are appropriate. This paper reports on one such analysis, 
a comparison of retrieval by marker passing or spreading activation
in a semantic network with Knowledge-Directed Spreading Activation, a
method developed to be well-suited for retrieving semantically distant
analogues from a large knowledge base. The analysis has two complementary 
components: (1) a theoretical model of the retrieval time based
on a number of problem characteristics, and (2) experiments showing
how the retrieval time of the approaches varies with the knowledge base
size. These two components, taken together, suggest that KDSA is more
likely than SA to be able to scale up to retrieval in large knowledge bases.
