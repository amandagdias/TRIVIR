Abstract
Fuzzy systems modeling technique and the case based reasoning methodology are briefly
described, It is then shown that these two approaches can be viewed as essentially involving
the same process, a matching step and a solution composition step. It is noted that in the
typical case based reasoning application the solution composition step is more difficult.
Two techniques are suggested to help in the solution composition task in case based
reasoning. The first, the weighted median, is useful in domains in which the action space
consists of an ordered collection of alternatives. The second, a variation of reinforcement
learning, is useful in domains in which the resulting actions involve a sequence of steps.
