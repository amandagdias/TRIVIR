INFORMATION EXTRACTION AS A BASIS FOR PORTABLE
TEXT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS

ABSTRACT
Knowledge­based natural language processing systems have achieved good success with many
tasks, but they often require many person­months of effort to build an appropriate knowledge
base. As a result, they are not portable across domains. This knowledge­engineering bottleneck
must be addressed before knowledge­based systems will be practical for real­world applications.
This dissertation addresses the knowledge­engineering bottleneck for a natural language processing
task called ``information extraction''. A system called AutoSlog is presented which automatically
constructs dictionaries for information extraction, given an appropriate training corpus. In the
domain of terrorism, AutoSlog created a dictionary using a training corpus and five person­hours
of effort that achieved 98% of the performance of a hand­crafted dictionary that took approximately
1500 person­hours to build.
This dissertation also describes three algorithms that use information extraction to support
high­precision text classification. As more information becomes available on­line, intelligent
information retrieval will be crucial in order to navigate the information highway efficiently
and effectively. The approach presented here represents a compromise between keyword­based
techniques and in­depth natural language processing. The text classification algorithms classify
texts with high accuracy by using an underlying information extraction system to represent
linguistic phrases and contexts. Experiments in the terrorism domain suggest that increasing the
amount of linguistic context can improve performance. Both AutoSlog and the text classification
algorithms are evaluated in three domains: terrorism, joint ventures, and microelectronics. An
important aspect of this dissertation is that AutoSlog and the text classification systems can be
easily ported across domains.
