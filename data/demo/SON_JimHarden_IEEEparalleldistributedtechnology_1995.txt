Abstract
A new multicomputer performance monitoring system is described in this     
paper.  Where possible, the system employs portable performance monitoring instrumentation                            
technology and leverages previous work.  Trace event acquisition is hardware assisted and                            
based on the MultiKron, a single chip measurement solution developed at the National             
Institute for Standards and Technology .  The user interface is based on the Pablo Performance                       
Analysis Environment, a visualization and sonification toolkit developed at the University of                         
Illinois.  The SPIscope is introduced as a component that bridges the gap between these            
emerging standard interfaces.  The SPIscope provides a high bandwidth path to a large                                 
secondary storage for recording performance data.  Connectivity to the user's performance     
analysis workstation is via a TCP/IP LAN.  Facilities are provided to support                                         
application±specific trace events, breakpoint style debugging, on line transmission of selected                       
data, and dynamic acquisition±rate control.  By using existing technology and interfaces, we                          
hope to contribute a performance monitoring component with greater utility throughout the                             
parallel processing community .
