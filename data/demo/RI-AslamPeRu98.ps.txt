Abstract. We present and analyze the star clustering algorithm. We
discuss an implementation of this algorithm that supports browsing and
document retrieval through information organization. We define three
parameters for evaluating a clustering algorithm to measure the topic
separation and topic aggregation achieved by the algorithm. In the ab­sence 
of benchmarks, we present a method for randomly generating clus­tering 
data. Data from our user study shows evidence that the star al­gorithm 
is effective for organizing information.
