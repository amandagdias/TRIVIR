Abstract
A fundamental problem that confronts peer­to­peer applications is
to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This
paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses
this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given
a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily
implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data
item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the
key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the
system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously
changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex­periments 
show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost
and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with
the number of Chord nodes.
