Abstract
Singular value decomposition (SVD) can be viewed as a method for
unsupervised training of a network that associates two classes of events
reciprocally by linear connections through a single hidden layer. SVD
was used to learn and represent relations among very large numbers of
words (20k­60k) and very large numbers of natural text passages (1k­
70k) in which they occurred. The result was 100­350 dimensional
"semantic spaces" in which any trained or newly added word or passage
could be represented as a vector, and similarities were measured by the
cosine of the contained angle between vectors. Good accuracy in
simulating human judgments and behaviors has been demonstrated by
performance on multiple­choice vocabulary and domain knowledge
tests, emulation of expert essay evaluations, and in several other ways.
Examples are also given of how the kind of knowledge extracted by this
method can be applied.
