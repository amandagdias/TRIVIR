Abstract A framework of combining object detection techniques with a CBSIR
system is discussed. As an example of the framework, a special CBSIR system which
decides the similarity of images based on background features is presented and back­
ground subimages can be extracted by using a face detector. This background search
can be used as a classification tool for pictures of home albums.
