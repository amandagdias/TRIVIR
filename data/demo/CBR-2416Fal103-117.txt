Abstract. We present an information visualisation tool, The Cube, as
a solution to the problem of visualising cases derived from large amounts
of clinical data. The Cube is based on the idea of dynamic 3D parallel diagrams, 
an idea similar to the notion of 3D parallel coordinate plots. The
Cube was developed to provide interactive visualisation of the case base
in terms of relationships between and within cases, in order to enhance
the clinician’s ability to intelligibly analyse existing patient material and
to allow for pattern recognition and statistical analysis.
The design and use of The Cube are presented and discussed. We show
how the declarative model used and the tight coupling between different
visualisation tools directly led to a similarity assessment-based solution
to the problem of finding a proper arrangement of dimensions in 3D
parallel coordinate displays. The declarative, user-centered nature of The
Cube makes it suitable for interactive case-based reasoning (CBR) and
opens up for the possibility of case-based visualisation for CBR.
