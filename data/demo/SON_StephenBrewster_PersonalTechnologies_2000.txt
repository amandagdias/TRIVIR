A problem with mobile computing devices is the output of dynamic information because their         
screens are small. This paper describes an experiment to investigate the use of non-speech sounds  
to present dynamic information without using visual display space. Results showed that non-speech 
sound could be used in a simple share-dealing scenario to present a ‘sound graph’ of share  
prices. This allowed participants to reduce the workload they had to invest in share-price monitoring 
as they could listen to the graph whilst they worked in a share accumulation window.
