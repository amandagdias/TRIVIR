Abstract                             
We present a new package which allows R to produce sound from data. 
The packages uses Csound, an extremely powerful and freely available multi
platform program for sound creation. Sonification is a relatively new branch
of data analysis, so even the basic set of concepts is still in ux. Our toolkit
hopefully makes research into different options for sonification methods more
accessible and helps to develop data based instruments in R.
