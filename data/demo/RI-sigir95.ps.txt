Abstract
Most information retrieval systems use stopword lists
and stemming algorithms. However, we have found
that recognizing singular and plural nouns, verb forms,
negation, and prepositions can produce dramatically
different text classification results. We present results
from text classification experiments that compare rel­evancy 
signatures, which use local linguistic context,
with corresponding indexing terms that do not. In two
different domains, relevancy signatures produced better
results than the simple indexing terms. These experi­ments 
suggest that stopword lists and stemming algo­
rithms may remove or conflate many words that could
be used to create more effective indexing terms.
