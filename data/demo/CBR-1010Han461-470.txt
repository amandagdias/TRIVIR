Abstract. This paper shows that the use of adaptation knowledge in
CBR systems is heavily dependent on certain task and system constraints. 
Furthermore, the type of adaptation knowledge used in systems
performing specific tasks is quite regular and predictable. These conclusions 
are reached by reviewing forty-two CBR systems and classifying
them according to three taxonomies: an adaptation-relevant taxonomy
of CBR systems, a taxonomy of tasks and a taxonomy of adaptation
knowledge. We then show how different systems cluster with respect to
interactions between these three taxonomies. The CBR system designer
may find the partition of CBR systems and the division of adaptation
knowledge suggested by this paper useful. Moreover, this paper may
help focus the initial stages of systems development by suggesting (on
the basis of existing work) what types of adaptation knowledge should be
supported by a new system. In addition, the paper provides a framework
for the preliminary evaluation and comparision of systems.
