1 Motivation

In our research work, we have come to represent cases as complex, structured data
structures that we will formally described as feature terms (see [Arcos] for a description of
the NOOS language for CBR and multistrategy leaming). The advantage of using
structured representations are twofold. Firstly, it offers a natural way to describe composite
objects that if described by attribute-value representations cause some problems like dealing
with irrelevant attributes, not-applicable values, etc (and this leads to problems when
comparing similitude among cases in this descriptions). Secondly. structured-
representation cases offer the capability of treating subparts of cases also as full-fledged
cases: they can be stored, and retrieved and used to solve (sub)problems of new cases;
also, a case may be solved using (subparts ot) multiple cases retneved from the system’s
memory. We will present here a formalization of structured (sometimes called object-centered) 
representations as feature terms and we will present how can we assess similarity
between feature terms (cases) and determine the preferred (most similar) case from a set of
cases.
