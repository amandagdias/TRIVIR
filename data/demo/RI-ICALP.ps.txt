Abstract. A Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol enables a user to re­trieve 
a data item from a database while hiding the identity of the item being
retrieved. In a t­private, k­server PIR protocol the database is replicated among
k servers, and the user's privacy is protected from any collusion of up to t servers.
The main cost­measure of such protocols is the communication complexity of re­trieving 
a single bit of data.
This work addresses the information­theoretic setting for PIR, in which the user's
privacy should be unconditionally protected from collusions of servers. We pre­sent 
a unified general construction, whose abstract components can be instanti­ated 
to yield both old and new families of PIR protocols. A main ingredient in
the new protocols is a generalization of a solution by Babai, Kimmel, and Lokam
to a communication complexity problem in the so­called simultaneous messages
model.
Our construction strictly improves upon previous constructions and resolves some
previous anomalies. In particular, we obtain: (1) t­private k­server PIR protocols
with O(n 1=b(2k 1)=tc
) communication bits, where n is the database size. For
t > 1, this is a substantial asymptotic improvement over the previous state of
the art; (2) a constant­factor improvement in the communication complexity of
1­private PIR, providing the first improvement to the 2­server case since PIR pro­tocols 
were introduced; (3) efficient PIR protocols with logarithmic query length.
The latter protocols have applications to the construction of efficient families of
locally decodable codes over large alphabets and to PIR protocols with reduced
work by the servers.
