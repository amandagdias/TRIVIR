Abstract
In this paper, we propose a methodto extract descriptions of techni­cal 
terms from Web pages in order to utilize the World Wide Web as
an encyclopedia. We use linguistic patterns and HTML text structures
to extract text fragments contain­ing term descriptions. We also use
a language model to discard extra­neous descriptions, and a clustering
method to summarize resultant de­scriptions. We show the effective­ness 
of our method by way of exper­iments.
