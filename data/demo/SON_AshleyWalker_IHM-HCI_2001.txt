We present a spatial audio display technique that overcomes the 
presentation rate bottleneck of traditional monaural audio displays. 
Our compact speech display works by encoding message semantics 
into the acoustic spatialisation. In user testing, this display facilitated 
better recall of events than a conventional small screen visual display. 
Moreover, results showed that this mapping aided in the recall of the 
absolute position of events as opposed to merely their relative 
orders in a temporally ordered data set.
