Abstract
Cross­language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different lan­guages, 
has of late become one of the major topics within the information retrieval community.
This paper proposes a Japanese/English CLIR system, where we combine a query translation
and retrieval modules. We currently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore
the performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation of techni­cal 
terms. However, the technical term translation is still problematic in that technical terms
are often compound words, and thus new terms are progressively created by combining existing
base words. In addition, Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
Consequently, existing dictionaries find it di#cult to achieve su#cient coverage. To counter the
first problem, we produce a Japanese/English dictionary for base words, and translate compound
words on a word­by­word basis. We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambigu­ity. 
For the second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words unlisted
in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the target language. We evaluate
our system using a test collection for CLIR, and show that both the compound word translation
and transliteration methods improve the system performance.
