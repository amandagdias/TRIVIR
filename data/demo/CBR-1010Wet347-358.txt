Abstract. Many case-based reasoning algorithms retrieve cases using a
derivative of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, whose similarity
function is sensitive to irrelevant, interacting, and noisy features. Many
proposed methods for reducing this sensitivity parameterize k-NN’s similarity 
function with feature weights. We focus on methods that automatically 
assign weight settings using little or no domain-specific knowledge.
Our goal is to predict the relative capabilities of these methods for specific 
dataset characteristics. We introduce a five-dimensional framework
that categorizes automated weight-setting methods, empirically compare
methods along one of these dimensions, summarize our results with four
hypotheses, and describe additional evidence that supports them. Our
investigation revealed that most methods correctly assign low weights
to completely irrelevant features, and methods that use performance
feedback demonstrate three advantages over other methods (i.e., they
require less pre-processing, better tolerate interacting features, and increase 
learning rate).
