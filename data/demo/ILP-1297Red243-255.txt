Abstract. A Horn definition is a set of Horn clauses with the same head
literal. In this paper, we consider learning non-recursive, function-free
first-order Horn definitions. We show that this class is exactly learnable
from equivalence and membership queries. It follows then that this class
is PAC learnable using examples and membership queries. Our results
have been shown to be applicable to learning efficient goal-decomposition
rules in planning domains.
