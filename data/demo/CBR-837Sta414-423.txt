Abstract. Even though today case-based reasoning is applied in a wide
range of different areas, there are only few systems which make use of case-based 
techniques for network management. In this paper, we outline the
domain of network management and highlight consequences for the
application of problem solvers operating in this domain. After this, we
present a case-based prototype performing a task of closed-loop network
management upon a simulated computer network together with first results.
