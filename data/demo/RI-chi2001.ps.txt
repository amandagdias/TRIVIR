ABSTRACT
A quantitative analysis of a large collection of expert­rated
web sites reveals that page­level metrics can accurately pre­dict 
if a site will be highly rated. The analysis also pro­vides 
empirical evidence that important metrics, including
page composition, page formatting, and overall page char­acteristics, 
differ among web site categories such as educa­tion, 
community, living, and finance. These results provide
an empirical foundation for web site design guidelines and
also suggest which metrics can be most important for evaluation 
via user studies.
