Abstract. This paper reports preliminary work on developing methods automatically 
to index cases described in text so that a case-based reasoning system
can reason with them. We are employing machine learning algorithms to classify
full-text legal opinions in terms of a set of predefined concepts. These factors,
representing factual strengths and weaknesses in the case, are used in the case-based 
argumentation module of our instructional environment CA TO. We first
show empirical evidence for the conncetion between the factor model and the
vector representation of texts developed in information retrieval. In a set of hypotheses 
we sketch how including knowledge about the meaning of the factors,
their relations and their use in the case-based reasoning system can improve
learning, and discuss in what ways background knowledge about the domain can
be beneficial. The paper presents initial experiments that show the limitations of
purely inductive algorithms for the task.
