Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) allows first-order 
learning and provides greater expressiveness than propositional learning. 
However, due to its tradeoff, the learning speed may not be reasonable for
datamining settings. To overcome this problem, this paper describes a
distributed implementation of an ILP engine, allowing speeding up 
optimal hypothesis searcb in inverse entailment according to the number
of processors. In this implementation, load balancing is achieved by 
contract net communication between the processors, resulting in a dynamic
allocation of the hypothesis search task. This paper describes our 
concurrent search algorithm, distributed implementation and experimental
results for speeding up inverse entailment. An initial experiment was
conducted to demonstrate the well-balanced task allocation.
