ABSTRACT
We present a unified model which, given the ranked lists
of documents returned by multiple retrieval systems in re­sponse 
to a given query, simultaneously solves the problems
of (1) fusing the ranked lists of documents in order to ob­tain 
a high­quality combined list (metasearch); (2) gener­ating 
document collections likely to contain large fractions
of relevant documents (pooling); and (3) accurately evalu­ating 
the underlying retrieval systems with small numbers
of relevance judgments (eficient system assessment). Our
approach is based on the Hedge algorithm for on­line learn­ing. 
In effect, our proposed system ``learns'' which docu­ments 
are likely to be relevant from a sequence of on­line
relevance judgments. In experiments using TREC data, our
methodology is shown to outperform standard methods for
metasearch, pooling, and system evaluation, often remark­
ably so.
