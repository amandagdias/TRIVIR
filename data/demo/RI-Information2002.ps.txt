Abstract:
Most existing systems of Information retrieval (IR) use
single words as index to represent the contents of documents
and queries. One of the consequences is the low recall level.
In this paper, we propose to integrate compound terms as
additional indexing units because terms are more precise
representation units than words. Terms are recognized
through the use of a terminology database and an automatic
term extraction tool, which is based on syntactic templates
and statistical analysis. In this paper, we first show that the
use of compound terms is greatly beneficial to monolingual
IR. Then compound terms are incorporated in statistical
translation models trained on a large set of parallel texts.
Our experiments on cross­language information retrieval
(CLIR) show that such a translation model leads to a much
better CLIR effectiveness when compound terms are
integrated.
