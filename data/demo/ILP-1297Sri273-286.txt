Abstract. Obtaining accurate structural alerts for the causes of chemical 
cancers is a problem of great scientific and humanitarian value. This
paper follows up on earlier research that demonstrated the use of Inductive 
Logic Programming (ILP) for predictions for the related problem of
mutagenic activity amongst nitroaromatic molecules. Here we are concerned 
with predicting carcinogenic activity in rodent bioassays using
data from the U.S. National Toxicology Program conducted by the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The 330 chemicals
used here are significantly more diverse than the previous study, and
form the basis for obtaining Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) relating 
molecular structure to cancerous activity in rodents. We describe
the use of the ILP system Progol to obtain SARs from this data. The
rules obtained from Progol are comparable in accuracy to those from
expert chemists, and more accurate than most state-of-the-art toxicity
prediction methods. The rules can also be interpreted to give clues about
the biological and chemical mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and make use
of those learnt by Progol for inutagenesis. Finally, we present details of,
and predictions for, an ongoing international blind trial aimed specifically
at comparing prediction methods. This trial provides ILP algorithms an
opportunity to participate at the leading-edge of scientific discovery.
