Abstract. As CBR system designers confront the problem of building programs 
that can explain their results, a logical representation of relevance
concepts will be useful. Our application, tutoring students to reason with
cases, necessitated adopting a declarative, logical representation of case-based 
relevance concepts. Representing relevance criteria in first-order logic
with LOOM has turned out not to be prohibitively expensive computationally 
and has had considerable advantages: it facilitates the use of multiple,
changing relevance criteria involving complex relationships among cases, we
have made some progress in enabling a program to explain aspects of its relevance 
criteria by example, and even students are beginning to express their
own queries in a simplified version of the language for CATO, our tutoring
program, to interpret.
