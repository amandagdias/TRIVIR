Abstract. A framework for combining Genetic Algorithms with LLP
methods is introduced and a novel binary representation and relevant
genetic operators are discussed. It is shown that the proposed representation 
encodes a subsumption lattice in a complete and compact way. It
is also shown that the proposed genetic operators are meaningful and can
be interpreted in ILP terms such as lgg(least general generalization) and
mgi (most general instance) . These operators can be used to explore a
subsumption lattice efficiently by doing binary operations (e.g. and/or).
An implementation of the proposed framework is used to combine Inverse
Entailment of CProgol with a genetic search.
