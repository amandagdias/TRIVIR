Abstract. There is a general acceptance that a case-based assistance
system that can meet the requirements of real-world complex applications 
should maintain a core of domain specific knowledge in combination
with its case store. The presented DOM-ArC incorporates a domain ontology 
and is situated within a case-based design support system. The
domain ontology incorporates not only deep domain knowledge, but also
the decision making knowledge that ensures the quality and reliability of
the domain cases. The DOM-ArC undertakes the role of an active assistant 
that supports the case-based reasoner with the following services.
It reviews and analyses a case and makes suggestions about which case
to retain, how to overcome deficiencies in a proposed solution, which
solution to reject, and how to construct a case from scratch.
