Abstract. In this paper we give a completeness theorem of an inductive 
inference rule inverse entailment proposed by Muggleton. Our main
result is that a hypothesis clause H can be derived from an example E
under a background theory B with inverse entailment if H subsumes E
relative to B in Plotkin’s sense. The theory B can be any clausal theory,
and the example E can be any clause which is neither a tautology nor
implied by B. The derived hypothesis H is a clause which is not always
definite. In order to prove the result we give a declarative semantics for
arbitrary consistent clausal theories, and show that SB-resolution, which
was originally introduced by Plotkin, is a complete procedural semantics.
The completeness is shown as an extension of the completeness theorem
of SLD-resolution. We also show that every hypothesis H derived with
saturant generalization, proposed by Rouveirol, must subsume E w.r.t.
B in Buntine’s sense. Moreover we show that saturant generalization can
be obtained from inverse entailment by giving some restriction to it.
