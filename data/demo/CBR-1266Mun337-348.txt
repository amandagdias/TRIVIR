Abstract. Determining the context of a feature (i.e., the factors affecting 
the ranking of a feature within a case) has been subject of several
studies in analysis tasks, particularly for classification but not in synthesis 
tasks like planning. In this paper we will address this problem and
explain how the domain theory plays a key role in determining the context 
of a feature. We provide a characterization of the domain theory and
show that in domains meeting this characterization, the context can be
simplified. We also use explanation-based learning techniques to determine 
the context in domains not meeting the characterization. Our work
relates for the first time CBR, machine learning and planning theory to
determine the context of a feature.
