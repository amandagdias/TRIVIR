Abstract . Compression measures used in inductive learners, such as
measures based on the MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle,
provide a theoretically justified basis for grading candidate hypotheses.
Compression-based induction is appropriate also for handling of noisy
data. This paper shows that a simple compression measure can be used
to detect noisy examples. A technique is proposed in which noisy examples 
are detected and eliminated from the training set, and a hypothesis
is then built from the set of remaining examples. The separation of noise
detection and hypothesis formation has the advantage that noisy examples 
do not influence hypothesis construction as opposed to most standard 
approaches to noise handling in which the learner typically tries to
avoid overfitting the noisy example set. Experimental results in a KRK
(king-rook-king) chess endgame domain show the potential of this novel
approach to noise handling.
