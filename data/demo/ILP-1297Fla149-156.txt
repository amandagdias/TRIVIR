Abstract. In this paper we study induction of unrestricted clausal theories
from interpretations. First, we show that in the propositional case induction
from complete evidence can be seen as an equivalence-preserving
transformation from DNF to CNF. From this we conclude that induction is
essentially a process of determining what is false in the domain of discourse.
We then proceed by investigating dual normal forms for evidence and
hypotheses in predicate logic. We define evidence normal form (ENE), which
is Skolemised existential DNF under a Consistent Naming Assumption.
Because ENF is incomplete, in the sense that it does not have the expressive
power of clausal logic, ENF evidence requires the identification of Skolem
terms. The approach is partly implemented in the PRIMUS system.
