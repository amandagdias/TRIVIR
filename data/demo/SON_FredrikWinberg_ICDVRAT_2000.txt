ABSTRACT                                                                
This paper presents a study of an auditory version of the game Towers of Hanoi. The goal of this study was to investigate 
the nature of continuos presentation and what this could mean when implementing auditory direct manipulation.                
We also wanted to find out if it was possible to make an auditory interface that met the requirements of a direct manipulation 
interface. The results showed that it was indeed possible to implement auditory direct manipulation, but 
using Towers of Hanoi as the underlying model restricted the possibilities of scaling the auditory space. The results also          
showed that having a limited set of objects, the nature of continuos presentation was not as important as how to interact         
with the auditory space.
