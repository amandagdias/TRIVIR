Abstract: Current Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) process models present CBR
as a low maintenance AI-technology and do not take the processes that have to
be enacted during system development and utilization into account. Since a
CBR system can only be useful if it is integrated into an organizational
structure and used by more than one user, processes for continuous knowledge
acquisition, -utilization and -maintenance have to be put in place. In this paper
the short-comings of classical CBR process models are analyzed, and, based on
the experiences made during the development of the case-based help-desk
support system HOMER, the managerial, organizational and technical
processes related to the development and utilization of CBR systems described.
