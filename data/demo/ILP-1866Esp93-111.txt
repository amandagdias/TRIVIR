Abstract. Induction of recursive theories in the normal ILP setting is a complex
task because of the non-monotonicity of the consistency property. In this paper
we propose computational solutions to some relevant issues raised by the
multiple predicate learning problem . A separate-and-parallel-conquer search
strategy is adopted to interleave the learning of clauses supplying predicates
with mutually recursive definitions. A novel generality order to be imposed to
the search space of clauses is investigated in order to cope with recursion in a
more suitable way. The consistency recovery is performed by reformulating the
current theory and by applying a layering technique based on the collapsed
dependency graph. The proposed approach has been implemented in the ILP
system ATRE and tested in the specific context of the document understanding
problem within the WISDOM project. Experimental results are discussed and
future directions are drawn.
