Abstract. This paper describes a system called IDIOM (Interactive Design 
using Intelligent Objects and Models) that was developed in order
to study model-based case combination and adaptation in design. Intelligent 
objects are defined to be parts of cases that are interpreted
at run-time by domain models and through user interaction. Incremental 
parameterization and dimensionality reduction ensures that design
solutions are proposed quickly and reliably. An implementation in the
domain of spatial composition for building designs demonstrates several
aspects of the approach.
