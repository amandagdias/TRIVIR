Abstract                                                       
Virtual environment research involves a number of related problems from a variety of
domains. A joint research at the George Washington University and the Naval Research Laboratory
is bringing together issues from these domains to study the factors that contribute to an integrated
virtual environment. The research can be divided into three general categories: human factors,
motion control, and sound synchronization. Human factors issues involve development of new
paradigms for movement and navigation essential for performance of general tasks in virtual spaces.
Novel approaches to motion control are being explored to help users of virtual environments
interact and control objects in the environment. This involves both interactive control as well as
automation through evolutionary approaches. The sounds being generated as a result of these
motions are modeled with compositional techniques to parameterize and synchronize them to the
events in the environment. The research is being approached from both a fundamental point of view
typical of an academic environment as well as from an application oriented point of view of interest
to the Navy. The cooperative relationship has benefited both the George Washington University
and the Naval Research Laboratory.
