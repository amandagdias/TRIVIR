Abstract. We can use a metric to measure the differences between elements 
in a domain or subsets of that domain (i.e. concepts). Which
particular metric should be chosen, depends on the kind of difference
we want to measure. The well known Euclidean metric on Rn and its
generalizations are often used for this purpose, but such metrics are not
always suitable for concepts where elements have some structure different 
from real numbers. For example, in (Inductive) Logic Programming
a concept is often expressed as an Herbrand interpretation of some first-order 
language. Every element in an Herbrand interpretation is a ground
atom which has a tree structure.
We start by defining a metric d on the set of expressions (ground atoms
and ground terms), motivated by the structure and complexity of the
expressions and the symbols used therein. This metric induces the Hausdorff 
metric h on the set of all sets of ground atoms, which allows us to
measure the distance between Herbrand interpretations. We then give
some necessary and some sufficient conditions for an upper bound of h
between two given Herbrand interpretations, by considering the elements
in their symmetric difference.
