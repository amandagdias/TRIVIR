Abstract. Yamamoto has shown that the Inverse Entailment(IE) mechanism 
described previously by the author is complete for Plotkin’s relative 
subsumption but incomplete for entailment. That is to say, an hypothesised 
clause H can be derived from an example E under a background theory B 
using IE if and only if H subsumes E relative to B in
Plotkin’s sense. Yamamoto gives examples of H for which B U H |= E
but H cannot be constructed using IE from B and E. The main result of
the present paper is a theorem to show that by enlarging the bottom set
used within IE, it is possible to make a revised version of IE complete
with respect to entailment for Horn theories. Furthermore, it is shown
for function-free definite clauses that given a bound k on the arity of
predicates used in B and E, the cardinality of the enlarged bottom set
is bounded above by the polynomial function p(c + 1)k, where p is the
number of predicates in B, E and c is the number of constants in B U E.
