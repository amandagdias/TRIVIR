Abstract. We present a novel application of ILP to the problem of
diterpene structure elucidation from 13C NMR spectra. Diterpenes are
organic compounds of low molecular weight that are based on a skeleton
of 20 carbon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial
interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new
pharmaceutical effectors. The structure elucidation of diterpenes based
on 13C NMR spectra is usually done manually by human experts with
specialized background knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. 
In the process, each of the 20 skeletal atoms is assigned an atom
number that corresponds to its proper place in the skeleton and the
diterpene is classified into one of the possible skeleton types. We address 
the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak
patterns for diterpenes with known structure. Recently, propositional
learning was successfully applied to learn classification rules from spectra 
with assigned atom numbers. As the assignment of atom numbers is
a difficult process in itself (and possibly indistinguishable from the classification 
process), we apply ILP, i.e., relational learning, to the problem
of classifying spectra without assigned atom numbers.
