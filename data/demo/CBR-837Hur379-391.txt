Abstract. This paper describes the application of case-based reasoning
(CBR) techniques to a complex domain, namely, mesh specification for
finite element analysis. The case-base provides a high-level store of information 
extracted through CPU-intensive numerical error analysis of
previously solved problems, making it available for mesh specification
before the simulation of new similar problems. Using this information,
a near-to-optimum mesh is specified as input to the simulation engine,
avoiding time-consuming computation during simulation. The paper describes 
the system, case representation, organisation and retrieval, and
compares the CBR approach with the more usual rule-based approaches
to this application domain.
