ABSTRACT
Advances in hardware performance, network bandwidthand audio
compression have made possible the creation of large personal   
digital music collections. Although, there is a significant body                                   
of work in image and video browsing, there has been little work                                     
that directly addresses the problem of audio and especially music                                      
browsing. In this paper, Musescape, a prototype music browsing                                     
system is described and evaluated. The main characteristics of the                                      
system are automatic configuration based on Computer Audition                                          
techniques and the use of continuous audio-music feedback while                                          
browsing and interacting with the system. The described ideas and                                         
techniques take advantage of the unique characteristics of music                                      
signals. A pilot user study was conducted to explore and evaluate                                      
the proposed user interface. The results indicate that the use of                                  
automatically extracted tempo information reduces browsing time                                         
and that continuous interactive audio feedback is appropriate for                                     
this particular domain.
