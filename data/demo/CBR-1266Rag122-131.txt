Abstract. This report describes a Technology Integration Experiment (TIE)
between the University of Maryland and The MITRE Corporation which was
undertaken as part of the (D)Arpa/Rome Laboratory Planning Initiative (ARPI).
This work led to an integration of the UM Parka-DB tool into the MITRE ForMAT
transportation planning tool.
