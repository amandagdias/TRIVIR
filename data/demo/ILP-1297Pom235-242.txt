Abstract. We discuss the problem of classification using the first order 
hypotheses. This paper proposes an enhancement of classification
based on the naive Bayesian scheme that is able to overcome the conditional 
independence assumption. Several experiments, involving some
artificial and real-world, both propositional and relational domains, were
conducted. The results indicate that the classification performance of
propositional learners is reached when the richer first-order knowledge
representation is not mandatory. This holds also in the domains where
such representation is more convenient. Our framework can also benefit
from the use of the hypotheses describing negative information. In such
case, the classification becomes more noise resistant.
