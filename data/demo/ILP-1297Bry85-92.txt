Abstract. As far as this author is aware, this is the first paper to describe 
the application of Progol to enantioseparations. A scheme is proposed 
for data mining a relational database of published enantio separations 
using Progol. The application of the scheme is described and a
preliminary assessment of the usefulness of the resulting generalisations
is made using their accuracy, size, ease of interpretation and chemical
justification.
