ABSTRACT                                           
We have been developing a haptic back display using a 3-by-3 tactor array.  This paper             
reports two studies that investigated the use of such a display for delivering attention- and          
direction-related information to its user.  The first study measured the effectiveness of haptic       
cues in redirecting an observer’s visual spatial attention.  The observer was first tapped on the      
back, and then asked to detect a change between two similar visual scenes.  We found that              
reaction time decreased by an average of 41% (1630 ms) when the location of the tactor                 
coincided with the quadrant of the visual scene where a change occurred.  We also found that           
reaction time increased by an average of 19% (781 ms) when the locations of the tapping and            
visual change did not coincide.  Such a haptic attentional cueing system can be beneficial to a        
user who must attend to information in small areas within a large and complex visual display           
(e.g., an aircraft cockpit).  In the second study, sequenced pulses were employed to impart            
directional information.  We found that naïve and minimally-trained observers were able to             
discern the directions of a set of horizontal, vertical and diagonal directional lines with an overall 
accuracy of 81%.  Means of improving the overall accuracy were suggested and tested.  These            
directional lines can be applied to a haptic navigation guidance or situation awareness system.
