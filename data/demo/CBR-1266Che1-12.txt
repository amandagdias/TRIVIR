Abstract - A case-based reasoning system for determining what colorants
to use for producing a specific color of plastic was created. The selection of
colorants needs to take many factors into consideration. A technique that
involved fuzzy logic was used to compare the quality of the color match for
each factor. The system has been in use for two years at a growing number
of GE Plastics sites and has shown significant cost savings.
