Abstract. This paper presents a novel case-based plan recognition system that
interprets observations of plan behavior using a case library of past
observations. The system is novel in that it represents a plan as a sequence of
action-state pairs rather than a sequence of actions preceded by some initial
state and followed by some final goal state. The system utilizes a unique
abstraction scheme to represent indices into the case base. The paper examines
and evaluates three different methods for prediction. The first method is
prediction without adaptation; the second is predication with adaptation, and the
third is prediction with heuristics. We show that the first method is better than a
baseline random prediction, that the second method is an improvement over the
first, and that the second and the third methods combined are the best overall
strategy.
