Abstract. An exemplar-based model with foundations in Bayesian networks 
is described. The proposed model utilises two Bayesian networks:
one for indexing of categories, and another for identifying exemplars
within categories. Learning is incrementally conducted each time a new
case is classified. The representation structure dynamically changes each
time a new case is classified and a coverage function is used as a basis
for selecting suitable exemplars. Finally, a simple example is given to
illustrate the concepts in the model.
