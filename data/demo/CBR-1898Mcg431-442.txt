Abstract. Automatically generating high-quality routes using real map
data is difficult for a number of reasons. Real maps rarely contain the
sort of information that is useful for constructing high quality routes. In
addition, the notion of “route quality” is difficult to define and is likely to
change from person to person. In this sense the automatic construction
of high-quality routes that match the preferences of individuals is an
example of a weak-theory problem, and therefore well suited to a case-based 
approach. In this paper we describe and evaluate a case-based
route planning system that is capable of efficiently generating routes
that reflect the implicit preferences of individual users.
