Abstract. Work on first-order clustering has primarily been focused
on the task of conceptual clustering, i.e., forming clusters with symbolic 
generalizations in the given representation language. By contrast,
for propositional representations, experience has shown that simple algorithms 
based exclusively on distance measures can often outperform
their concept-based counterparts. In this paper, we therefore build on
recent advances in the area of first-order distance metrics and present
RDBC, a bottom-up agglomerative clustering algorithm for first-order
representations that relies on distance information only and features a
novel parameter-free pruning measure for selecting the final clustering
from the cluster tree. The algorithm can empirically be shown to produce 
good clusterings (on the mutagenesis domain) that, when used for
subsequent prediction tasks, improve on previous clustering results and
approach the accuracies of dedicated predictive learners.
