Abstract                                                  
The auditive modality, such as speech, signals and natural sounds, is one of the most important ways to          
present and communicate information. However, in computer interfaces the possibilities of auditive modality 
have been almost totally neglected. Usually the audio consists of simple signals (beeps and clicks)       
or background music. The present paper outlines some of the possibilities in presenting and managing             
information in computers by using audio from the perspective of the semiotic theory of signs. Auditive           
interfaces can be especially useful for people with visual or kinaesthetic disabilities, as well as in places    
and with devices when the visual-kinaesthetic using of the machine is difficult, for example while on the        
move or with small display devices.
