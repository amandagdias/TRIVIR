Abstract
The increasing availability of online databases and
other information resources in digital libraries has
created the need for efficient and effective algo­rithms 
for selecting databases to search. A number
of techniques have been proposed for query rout­ing 
or database selection. We have developed a
methodology and metrics that can be used to di­rectly 
compare competing techniques. They can
also be used to isolate factors that influence the
performance of these techniques so that we can better 
understand performance issues. In this paper
we describe the methodology we have used to ex­amine 
the performance of database selection algo­
rithms such as gGlOSS and CORI. In addition we
develop the theory behind a ``random'' database
selection algorithm and show how it can be used
to help analyze the behavior of realistic database
selection algorithms.
