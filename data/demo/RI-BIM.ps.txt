Abstract
Private information retrieval (PIR) enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database,
replicated among one or more servers, while hiding the identity of the retrieved item. This
problem was suggested by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan in 1995, and since then
efficient protocols with sub-linear communication were suggested. However, in all these protocols
the servers' computation for each retrieval is at least linear in the size of entire database, even
if the user requires only a single bit.
In this paper, we study the computational complexity of PIR. We show that in the standard
PIR model, where the servers hold only the database, linear computation cannot be avoided. To
overcome this problem we propose the model of PIR with preprocessing: Before the execution of
the protocol each server may compute and store polynomially-many information bits regarding
the database; later on, this information should enable the servers to answer each query of the
user with more e∆cient computation.
We demonstrate that preprocessing can significantly save work. In particular, we construct
for any constants k  2 and  > 0: (1) a k-server protocol with O(n 1=(2k 1) ) communication,
O(n= log 2k 2 n) work, and O(n 1+ ) storage; (2) a k-server protocol with O(n 1=k+ ) communication 
and work and n O(1) storage; (3) a computationally-private k-server protocol with O(n  )
communication, O(n 1=k+ ) work, and n O(1) storage; and (4) a protocol with a polylogarithmic
number of servers, polylogarithmic communication and work, and O(n 1+ ) storage. On the
lower bounds front, we prove that the product of the extra storage used by the servers (i.e., in
addition to the length of the database) and the expected amount of work is at least linear in n.
Finally, we suggest two alternative models to saving computation, by batching queries and by
allowing a separate online interaction per future query.
