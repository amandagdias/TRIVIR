Abstract. This paper reviews our recent work on applying inductive
logic programming to the construction of natural language processing
systems. We have developed a system, CHILL, that learns a parser from a
training corpus of parsed sentences by inducing heuristics that control an
initial overly-general shift-reduce parser. CHILL learns syntactic parsers
as well as ones that translate English database queries directly into 
executable logical form. The ATIS corpus of airline information queries was
used to test the acquisition of syntactic parsers, and CHILL performed
competitively with recent statistical methods. English queries to a small
database on U.S. geography were used to test the acquisition of a 
complete natural language interface, and the parser that CHILL acquired was
more accurate than an existing hand-coded system. The paper also 
includes a discussion of several issues this work has raised regarding the
capabilities and testing of ILP systems as well as a summary of our
current research directions.
