Abstract. A learning algorithm for the class of range restricted Horn
expressions is presented and proved correct. The algorithm works within
the framework of learning from entailment, where the goal is to exactly
identify some pre-fixed and unknown expression by making questions to
membership and equivalence oracles. This class has been shown to be
learnable in previous work. The main contribution of this paper is in
presenting a more direct algorithm for the problem which yields an improvement 
in terms of the number of queries made to the oracles. The
algorithm is also adapted to the class of Horn expressions with inequalities 
on all syntactically distinct terms where a significant improvement
in the number of queries is obtained.
