Abstract. In this paper, we present an algorithm for the discovery of first order 
clauses holding in an relational database in the framework of the nonmonotonic 
ILP setting [1]. The algorithm adopts the principle of offline candidate
determination algorithm used for mining association rules in large transaction
databases [4]. Analoguous to the measures used in mining association rules, we
define a support and a confidence measure as acceptance criteria for discovered
hypothesis clauses.
The algorithm has been implemented in C with an interface to the relational
database management system INGRES. We present and discuss the results of
an experiment in the KRK domain and conclude.
