Abstract                                    
This paper describes "From Dots to Shapes" (FDTS), an auditory platform composed by three
classic games (Simon, Point Connecting and concentration game) for blind and visually
impaired pupils. Each game was adapted to work on a concept of the Euclidean geometry (e.g. )
The tool, , is based on sonic and haptic interaction, and therefore could be used by special
educators as a help for teaching basic planar geometry.
