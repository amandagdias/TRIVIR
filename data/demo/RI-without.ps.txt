Abstract--- All known constructions of information theo­retic 
t­out­of­n secret sharing schemes require secure, private
communication channels among the parties for the reconstruction 
of the secret. In this work we investigate the cost
of performing the reconstruction over public communication
channels. A naive implementation of this task distributes
2n \Gamma 2 one times pads to each party. This results in shares
whose size is 2n \Gamma 1 times the secret size. We present three
implementations of such schemes that are substantially more
efficient:
ffl A scheme enabling multiple reconstructions of the se­cret 
by different subsets of parties, with factor O(n=t)
increase in the shares' size.
ffl A one­time scheme, enabling a single reconstruction of
the secret, with O(log(n=t)) increase in the shares' size.
ffl A one­time scheme, enabling a single reconstruction by
a set of size exactly t, with factor O(1) increase in the
shares' size.
We prove that the first implementation is optimal (up to
constant factors) by showing a tight \Omega\Gamma n=t) lower bound for
the increase in the shares' size.
