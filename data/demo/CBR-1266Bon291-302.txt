Abstract. We can learn a lot about what features are important for
retrieval by comparing similar cases in a case-base. We can determine
which features are important in predicting outcomes and we can assign
weights to features accordingly. In the same manner we can discover
which features are important in specific contexts and determine
localised feature weights that are specific to individual cases. In this
paper we describe a comprehensive set of techniques for learning local
feature weights and we evaluate these techniques on a case-base for
conflict resolution in air traffic control. We show how introspective
learning of feature weights improves retrieval and how it can be used to
determine context sensitive local weights. We also show that
introspective learning does not work well in case-bases containing only
pivotal cases because there is no redundancy to be exploited.
