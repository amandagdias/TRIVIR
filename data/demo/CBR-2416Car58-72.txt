Abstract. The amount and availability of high-quality geo-spatial image 
data, such as digital satellite and aerial photographs, is increasing
dramatically. Task-based management of such visual information and
associated knowledge is a central concern for organisations that rely on
digital imagery. We are developing geo-spatial knowledge management
techniques that employ case-based reasoning as the core methodology. In
order to provide effective retrieval of task-based experiences that center
around geo-spatial imagery, we need to forward novel similarity metrics
for directly comparing the image components of experience cases. Based
on work in geo-spatial image database retrieval, we are building an effective 
similarity metric for geo-spatial imagery that makes comparisons
based on derived image features, their shapes, and the spatial relations
between them. This paper gives an overview of the geo-spatial knowledge
management context, describes our image similarity metric, and provides
an initial evaluation of the work.
