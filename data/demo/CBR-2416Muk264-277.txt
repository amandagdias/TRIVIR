Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to acquire cases in the context
of project planning, without any extra effort from the end user. Under our
definition, a case has a one to one correspondence with the standard elements of
a project plan. We exploit this correspondence to capture cases automatically
from project planning episodes. We provide an algorithm for extracting cases
from project plans. We implemented this algorithm on top of a commercial
project-planning tool and perform experiments evaluating our approach.
