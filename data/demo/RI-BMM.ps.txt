The All-or-Nothing Nature of
Two-Party Secure Computation

Abstract
A function f is computationally securely computable if two computationally-bounded
parties, Alice, having a secret input x, and Bob, having a secret input y, can talk back
and forth so that (even if one of them is malicious) (1) Bob learns essentially only
f(x; y) while (2) Alice learns essentially nothing.
We prove that, if any non-trivial function can be so computed, then so can every
function. Consequently, the complexity assumptions su∆cient and/or required for
computationally securely computing f are the same for every non-trivial function f .
