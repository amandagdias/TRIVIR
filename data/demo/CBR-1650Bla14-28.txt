Abstract. This paper is focused on a class of metrics for the Nearest
Neighbor classifier, whose definition is based on statistics computed on
the case base. We show that these metrics basically rely on a probability 
estimation phase. In particular, we reconsider a metric proposed
in the 80’s by Short and Fukunaga, we extend its definition to an input 
space that includes categorical features and we evaluate empirically
its performance. Moreover, we present a novel probability based metric,
called Minimum Risk Metric (MRM), i.e. a metric for classification tasks
that exploits estimates of the posterior probabilities. MRM is optimal,
in the sense that it optimizes the finite misclassification risk, whereas
the Short and Fukunaga Metric minimizes the difference between finite
risk and asymptotic risk. An experimental comparison of MRM with the
Short and Fukunaga Metric, the Value Difference Metric, and Euclidean—Hamming m
etrics on benchmark datasets shows that MRM outperforms
the other metrics. MRM performs comparably to the Bayes Classifier
based on the same probability estimates. The results suggest that MRM
can be useful in case-based applications where the retrieval of a nearest
neighbor is required.
