Abstract. Stratified case-based reasoning (SCBR) is a technique in which case
abstractions are used to assist case retrieval, matching, and adaptation. Previous
work has shown that SCBR can significantly decrease the computational
expense required for retrieval, matching, and adaptation under a variety of
different problem conditions. This paper extends this work to two new domains:
a problem in combinatorial optimization, sorting by prefix reversal; and
logistics planning. An empirical evaluation in the prefix-reversal problem
showed that SCBR reduced search cost, but severely degraded solution quality.
By contrast, in logistics planning, use of SCBR as an indexing mechanism led
to faster solution times and permitted more problems to be solved than either
hierarchical problem solving (by ALPINE) or ground level CBR (by SPA)
alone. The primary factor responsible for the difference in SCBR’s performance
in these two domains appeared to be that the optimal-case utility was low in the
prefix-reversal task but high in logistics planning.
