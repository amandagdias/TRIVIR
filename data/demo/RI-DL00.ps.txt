ABSTRACT
This paper reports on measurements of the NCSTRL digital
library taken over a two­year period. We report the growth
of the system along two dimensions: number of participating
institutions and number of documents indexed by the system.
We also report an aspect of reliability for this distributed dig­ital 
library system.
