Abstract. Generalized cases are cases that cover a subspace rather than
a point in the problem-solution space. Generalized cases can be represented 
by a set of constraints over the case attributes. For such representations, 
the similarity assessment between a point query and generalized
cases is a difficult problem that is addressed in this paper. The task is
to find the distance (or the related similarity) between the point query
and the closest point of the area covered by the generalized cases, with
respect to some given similarity measure. We formulate this problem as a
mathematical optimization problem and we propose a new cutting plane
method which enables us to rank generalized cases according to their
distance to the query.
