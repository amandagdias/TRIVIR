Abstract
Often, information retrieval from various other
media is analogous to text­based retrieval; how­
ever, accessing documents in e.g. audio or video
formats causes some extra problems, in particular
with respect to document segmentation, choice
of indexing features, and robustness. We review
these diOEculties, together with some previous at­
tempts to overcome them, and then describe a
very AEexible, modular IR system which has been
designed with a speciøc eye towards these issues.
