Abstract. This paper describes a bottom-up ILP algorithm called MRI,
which induces recursive programs with one or more recursive clauses from
a few of examples. It analyzes saturations using path structures, which
express streams of terms processed by predicates and was originally introduced 
by Identam-Almquist. We introduce extension and difference
of path structures. Recursive clauses can be expressed as a difference
among path structures. The paper also shows experimental results.
