Abstract
We present Scatter/Gather, a cluster­based document brows­ing 
method, as an alternative to ranked titles for the orga­nization 
and viewing of retrieval results. We systematically
evaluate Scatter/Gather in this context and find significant
improvements over similarity search ranking alone. This
result provides evidence validating the cluster hypothesis
which states that relevant documents tend to be more sim­ilar 
to each other than to non­relevant documents. We de­scribe a
system employing Scatter/Gather and demonstrate
that users are able to use this system close to its full poten­tial.
