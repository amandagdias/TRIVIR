Abstract. The success of a case-based reasoning system depends critically on
the performance of the retrieval algorithm used and, specifically, on its
efficiency, competence, and quality characteristics. In this paper we describe a
novel retrieval technique that is guided by a model of case competence and that,
as a result, benefits from superior efficiency, competence and quality features.
