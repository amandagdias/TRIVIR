Abstract. We study the problem of inducing normal programs of multiple 
predicates in the empirical ILP setting. We identify a class of normal
logic programs that can be handled and induced in a top-down manner
by an intensional system. We propose an algorithm called NMPL that
improves the multiple predicate learning system MPL and extends its
language from definite to this class of normal programs. Finally, we discuss 
the cost of the MPL’s refinement algorithm and present theoretical
and experimental results showing that NMPL can be as effective as MPL
and is computationaily cheaper than it.
