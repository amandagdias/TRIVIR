Abstract: ­ The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a transformation that can be used to analyze the
temporal and spectral properties of non­stationary signals like audio. In this paper we describe some
applications of the DWT to the problem of extracting information from non­speech audio. More specifically
automatic classification of various types of audio using the DWT is described and compared with other
traditional feature extractors proposed in the literature. In addition, a technique for detecting the beat attributes
of music is presented. Both synthetic and real world stimuli were used to evaluate the performance of the beat
detection algorithm.
