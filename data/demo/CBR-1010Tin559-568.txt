Abstract. In instance-based learning, two different metrics are usually
used for continuous-valued attributes and nominal attributes. The problem 
of using different metrics in domains which have both types of attribute 
has been mitigated by methods such as attribute and instance
weightings in instance-based learning.
This paper investigates a method that treats both types of attribute
using a single uniform metric in instance-based learning. The method
transforms continuous-valued attributes into nominal attributes through
discretisation at the outset. We empirically examine the approach using
both real-world and artificial datasets to characterise the benefits of discretisation 
and using a single uniform metric in instance-based learning.
Results indicate that our approach can be beneficial to instance-based
learning in domains which have noise or irrelevant attributes.
