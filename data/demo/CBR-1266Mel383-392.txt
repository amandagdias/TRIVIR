Abstract. Two major problems in case-based reasoning are the efficient
and justified retrieval of source cases and the adaptation of retrieved
solutions to the conditions of the target. For analogical theorem proving
by induction, we describe how a solution-relevant abstraction can restrict
the retrieval of source cases and the mapping from the source problem to
the target problem and how it can determine reformulations that further
adapt the source solution.
