Abstract. For the improvement of software quality and productivity, organizations 
need to systematically build up and reuse software engineering know-how,
promoting organizational learning in software development. Therefore, an integrated 
support platform has to be developed for capturing, storing and retrieving
software engineering knowledge. Technical support is complicated through specific 
characteristics of the software engineering domain, such as the lack of
explicit domain models in practice and the diversity of environments. Applying
Case-Based Reasoning, we propose an approach for the representation of relevant 
software engineering experiences, the goal-oriented and similarity-based
retrieval tailorable to organization-specific characteristics and the continuous
acquisition of new experiences. The approach is applied and validated in the
context of the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) approach, an innovative technology
for software measurement.
