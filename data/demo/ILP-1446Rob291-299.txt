Abstract. This paper presents an experimental comparison of two Inductive 
Logic Programming algorithms, PROGOL and TILDE, with C4.5,
a propositional learning algorithm, on a propositional dataset of road
traffic accidents. Rebalancing methods are described for handling the
skewed distribution of positive and negative examples in this dataset ,
and the relative cost of errors of commission and omission in this domain. 
It is noted that before the use of these methods all algorithms
perform worse than majority class. On rebalancing, all did significantly
better. The conclusion drawn from the experimental results is that on
such a propositional dataset ILP algorithms perform competitively in
terms of predictive accuracy with propositional systems, but are significantly 
outperformed in terms of time taken for learning.
