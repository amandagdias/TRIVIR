Abstract. Cohen’s [1] refinement rules provide a flexible mechanism
for introducing intentional background knowledge in an ILP system.
Whereas Cohen used a limited second order theorem prover to implement 
the rule interpreter, we extend the method to use a full Prolog
interpreter. This makes the introduction of more complex background
knowledge possible. Although refinement rules have been used to generate 
literals for a general-to-specific search, we show how they can also be
used as filters to reduce the number of literals in an RLGG algorithm.
Each literal constructed by the LGG is tested against the refinement
rules and only admitted if a refinement rule has been satisfied.
