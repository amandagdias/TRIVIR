Abstract. This paper defines a selection problem which selects an 
appropriate object from a set that is specified by parameters. We discuss
inductive learning of selection problems and give a method combining
inductive logic programming (ILP) and Bayesian learning. It induces
a binary relation comparing likelihood of objects being selected. Our
methods estimate probability of each choice by evaluating variance of an
induced relation from an ideal binary relation. Bayesian learning 
combines a prior probability of objects and the estimated probability. By
making several assumptions on probability estimation, we give several
methods. The methods are applied to Part-of-Speech tagging.
