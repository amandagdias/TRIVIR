ABSTRACT
New Interfaces for Musical Expression must speak to the                                                               
nature of instrument, that is, it must always be understood                                                         
that the interface binds to a complex musical phenomenon.                                                             
This paper explores the nature of engagement, the point of                                                            
performance that occurs when a human being engages with a                                                             
computer based instrument.  It asks questions about the nature                                                        
of the instrument in computer music and offers some                                                                   
conceptual models for the mapping of gesture to sonic                                                                 
outcomes.
