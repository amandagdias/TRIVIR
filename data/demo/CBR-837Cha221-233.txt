Abstract. The paper introduces and examines the relevance of the notion of
"interpolation" between case features, to facilitate fast adaptation of existing
cases to a current situation. When this situation is time-critical there is not enough
time for exhaustive comparison of various aspects of all the stored cases, so it
may not be possible to retrieve a high-quality match for a current problem within
a specified time-limit. Viewing imperfect adaptation as a process of interpolation
(or a set of possible processes with different qualities of interpolation) then gives
a robust and novel perspective for time-critical reasoning, as well as being
equally relevant for case-based reasoning (CBR) in general. Although
interpolation-like adaptation techniques have been used in some existing CBR
systems, they have not previously been treated explicitly from this perspective.
