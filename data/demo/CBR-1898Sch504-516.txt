Abstract. Existing electronic shops based on CBR technology allow
customers to search for adequate products by only specifying the attributes 
for the products in a fuzzy way. Unfortunately, most electronic
shops do not further support customers after the retrieval step. However,
especially configurable products could be customized at this stage. Based
on the approach of interactive adaptation operators, we present a flexible 
system architecture for a customization module which can be easily
integrated in electronic shops. Our approach of a modular adaptation
concept is implemented and currently tested within the ESPRIT project
