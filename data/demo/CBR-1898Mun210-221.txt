Abstract. Some problem-solving tasks are amenable to integrated case
retrieval and generative planning techniques. This is certainly true for
some decision support tasks, in which a user controls the problem-solving
process but cannot provide a complete domain theory. Unfortunately,
existing integrations are either non-interactive or require a complete domain 
theory and/or complete world state to produce acceptable plans,
preventing them from being easily used in these situations. We describe
a novel integrated algorithm, named SiN, that is interactive aud does
not require a complete domain theory or complete world state. SiN users
leverage a conversational case retriever to focus both partial world state
acquisition and plan generation. We highlight the benefits of SiN (e.g.,
quadratically fewer cases needed) in an experimental study using a new
travel planning domain.
