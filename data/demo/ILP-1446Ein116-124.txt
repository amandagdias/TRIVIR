Abstract. The paper reports a pilot study aiming at inducing rules for
disambiguating words with different possible part of speech readings in
unrestricted Swedish text. The rules, which are inspired by Constraint
Grammar, are learnt using the Progol inductive logic programming system. 
The training data is sampled from the part of speech tagged one
million word Stockholm-Umeå Corpus. The results show that the induction 
of disambiguation rules using Progol is a realistic way of learning
rules of good quality with a minimum of manual effort. When tested on
unseen data, 97% of the words retain the correct reading after tagging
leaving an ambiguity of 1.15 readings per word.
