Abstract. The goal of the work described in this paper is to provide
a general and underlying model of memory to support the process of
Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The approach taken is to build a range
of biasing constraint into the structure of memory itself and to use a
suitably designed activation passing process to exploit this information
as a guide for the retrieval of appropriate source cases. This provides the
potential for highly flexible case retrieval without the need for exhaustive
search of memory. This claim is supported by initial experimentation
using a prototype implementation of the memory model.
