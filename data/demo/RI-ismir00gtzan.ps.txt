Abstract
The majority of work in music information retrieval (IR) has been focused on
symbolic representations of music. However, most of the digitally available
music is in the form of raw audio signals. Although various attempts at
monophonic and polyphonic transcription have been made, none has been
successful and general enough to work with real world signals.
In this paper we describe some initial e#orts at building IR tools for
real world audio signals. Our approach is based on signal processing, sta­tistical 
pattern recognition and visualization techniques. We try to gather
as much information as possible without attempting to perform polyphonic
transcription.
A frequently ignored aspect in emerging fields like music IR is the im­portance 
of the user in building a successful system. We describe some new
graphical user interfaces that accommodate di#erent modes of interaction
with the user. More specifically we describe an augmented sound editor for
annotating, classifying and segmenting music and we define TimbreGrams
a new visual representation for audio files.
