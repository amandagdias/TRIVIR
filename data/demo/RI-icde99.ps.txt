Abstract
Clustering partitions a collection of objects into groups
called clusters, such that similar objects fall into the same
group. Similarity between objects is defined by a distance
function satisfying the triangle inequality; this distance
function along with the collection of objects describes a dis­tance 
space. In a distance space, the only operation possi­ble 
on data objects is the computation of distance between
them. All scalable algorithms in the literature assume a spe­cial 
type of distance space, namely a k­dimensional vector
space, which allows vector operations on objects.
We present two scalable algorithms designed for cluster­
ing very large datasets in distance spaces. Our first algo­rithm 
BUBBLE is, to our knowledge, the first scalable clus­tering 
algorithm for data in a distance space. Our second
algorithm BUBBLE­FM improves upon BUBBLE by reduc­ing 
the number of calls to the distance function, which may
be computationally very expensive. Both algorithms make
only a single scan over the database while producing high
clustering quality. In a detailed experimental evaluation,
we study both algorithms in terms of scalability and quality
of clustering. We also show results of applying the algo­rithms 
to a real­life dataset.
