Abstract. The recent progress in Case- Based Reasoning has shown that one of the
most important challenges in developing future AL methods will be to combine and
synergistically utilize general and case-based knowledge. In this paper a very
rudimentary kind of integration for the classification task, based on simple
heuristics, is sketched: “To solve a problem, first try to use the conventional rule-based 
approach. If it does not work, try to remember a similar problem you have
solved in the past and adapt the old solution to the new situation”. This heuristic
approach is based on the knowledge base that consists of rule base and exception
case base. The method of generating this kind of knowledge base from a set of
examples is described. The proposed approach is tested, and compared with
altemative approaches. The experimental results show that the presented integration
method can lead to an improvement in accuracy and comprehensibility.
