Abstract. Many of today’s CBR systems are passive in nature: they
require human users to activate them manually and to provide information 
about the incoming problem explicitly. In this paper, we present an
integrated system that combines CBR system with an active database
system. Active databases, with the support of active rules, can perform
event detecting, condition monitoring, and event handling (action execution) 
in an automatic manner. The combined ActiveCBR system consists
of two layers. In the lower layer, the active database is rule-driven; in the
higher layer, the result of action execution of active rules is transformed
into feature-value pairs required by the CBR subsystem. The layered
architecture separates case-based reasoning from complicated rule-based
reasoning, and improves the traditional passive CBR system with the
active property. This paper shows how to construct ActiveCBR system
and provides an analysis of the resulting system architecture.
