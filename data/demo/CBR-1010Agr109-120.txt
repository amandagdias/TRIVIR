Abstract. The paper deals with the problem of improving problem-solving 
behavior of traditional KBS in the course of its real operation
which is a part of the maintenance task. The solution of the problem is
searched in integration of the KBS with a specially designed case-based
reasoning module used for correcting solutions produced by the KBS.
Special attention is paid to the methods of case matching and reconciling 
conflicts between CBR and RBR. The proposed solution for both
problems is based on treating the maintenance task as a problem for
learning two-tiered domain representation. From this view point rules
form the first domain tier reflecting existing strong patterns in the representation 
of domain concepts, while the second tier is formed by the
newly solved cases along with a special domain-dependent procedure for
case matching. The main ideas of the approach are illustrated by the
results of some experiments with the experimental system CoRCase.
