Abstract. Recent research activities in the field of attribute selection for
carrying on dialogs with on-line customers have focused on entropy-based
approaches that make use of information gain measures. These measures
consider the distribution of attribute values in the case base and are focused on
their ability to reduce dialog length. The implicit knowledge contained in the
similarity measures is neglected. In previous work, we proposed the similarity-influenced 
selection method sim Var, which selects the attributes that induce the
maximum change in similarity distribution amongst the candidate cases,
thereby partitioning the case base into similar and dissimilar cases. In this paper
we present an evaluation of the selection methods using three domains with
distinct characteristics. The comparison of the selection methods is based on the
quality of the dialogs generated. Statistical analysis was used to support the
evaluation results.
