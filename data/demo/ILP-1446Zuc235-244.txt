Abstract. This paper describes a new kind of language bias, S-structural
indeterminate clauses, which takes into account the meaning of predicates that
play a key role in the complexity of learning in structural domains. Structurally
indeterminate clauses capture an important background knowledge in structural
domains such as medicine, chemistry or computational linguistics: the
specificity of the component/object relation. The REPART algorithm has been
specifically developed to learn such clauses. Its efficiency lies in a particular
change of representation so as to be able to use propositional learners. Because
of the indeterminacy of the searched clauses the propositional learning problem
to be solved is a kind of Multiple-Instance problem. Such reformulations may
be a general approach for learning non determinate clauses in ILP. This paper
presents original results discovered by REPART that exemplify how ILP
algorithms may not only scale up efficiently to large relational databases but
also discover useful and computationally hard-to-learn patterns.
