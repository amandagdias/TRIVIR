Abstract. We propose in this paper a new approach for learning predicate 
definitions from examples and from an initial theory. The particularity 
of this approach consists in inventing both a new predicate symbol
and a specification for this predicate at most steps of learning. The specifications 
that are built are incomplete and imprecise, what is modelized
by introducing the notion of o-interpretation. At the end of the learning
task, some invented predicates are removed by unfolding techniques. The
remaining predicates either enable to simplify the program, or are defined 
by recursive programs. In the second case, the program could not
have been learned without inventing these predicates.
The method has been implemented in a system, called SPILP, which
has been successfully tested for inventing predicates which simplify the
learned programs as well as for inventing recursively defined predicates.
Let us point out that the introduction of o-interpretations gives us a
general framework for dealing with imprecise specifications and that
SPILP can work, even when the target concepts are also incompletely
defined by o-interpretations.
