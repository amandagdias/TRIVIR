Abstract. In order to use descriptions logics for case-based reasoning it must
be possible to use primitive datatypes such as numbers and strings within the
representation and inference mechanisms of the logic. The best way to do so is
via so called admissible concrete domains. In this paper we address the general
problem of the admissibility of concrete domains, using the application area of
the retrieval of bibliographic data as an example. We investigate the theoretical
limitations on admissible concrete domains over numbers and strings imposed by
decidability results known from mathematical logic and automata theory, as well
as the prospects of potential implementations in our description logic CTL.
