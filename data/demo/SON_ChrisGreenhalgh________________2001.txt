ABSTRACT                                                      
We present seven diverse augmented reality interfaces                                                               
including audio tunnels from a virtual environment to fixed   
and mobile phones; digital activity meters for locating       
hotspots of activity in a parallel virtual world; a tripod   
mounted display for small groups to view virtual events;                                                            
and public projections of shadows and sound from a virtual  
world. An analys is of how these match different design     
goals and real world constraints demonstrates the potential 
utility of each. We explore how the use of a shared         
underlying virtual world enables multiple interfaces such as
these to be coordinated to provide a rich and coherent 
augmented reality experience.
