Case oriented tutoring gives students the possibility to practice their acquired
theoretical knowledge in the context of concrete cases. Accordingly, tutoring
systems for individualized learning have to take the skills of students at
applying their knowledge to problem solving into account. This paper describes
a case-based methodology for planning tutoring processes depending on the
skills of individual users. We develop methods for retrieving tutoring plans of
users with similar skills and present adaptation techniques for improving these
plans based on the student’s behavior during the corresponding tutoring
process. The developed methodology is based on the notion that a student has to
perform threads of associations in the process of problem solving.
