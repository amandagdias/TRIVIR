Abstract

Tabu search is an established heuristic optimisation technique for problems where
exact algorithms are not available. It belongs to the same family as simulated
annealing or genetic algorithms. It extends the basic iterative improvement scheme by
adding control learning. A technique of this kind, intensification, captures experience
established on a frequency-based analysis of past search. Experience is reused while
the same optimisation process is going on in order to guide search to better solutions.
In this paper, we introduce a case-based reasoning approach for control learning in
tabu search. Search experience concerns operator selection and is represented by cases.
The aim of case reuse is to improve conflict resolution. While the proposed method is
domain independent, we present its application to the NP-hard uncapacitated facility
location problem. Experimental results show that adding our approach to a basic tabu
search optimisation significantly improves solution quality on the evaluated
benchmark problems. It reduces the gap to the optimal solution by a factor of nearly 2.
