Abstract. This paper presents a web based recommender system aimed
at supporting a user in information filtering and product bundling. The
system enables the selection of travel locations, activities and attractions,
and supports the bundling of a personalized travel plan. A travel plan is
composed in a mixed initiative way: the user poses queries and the recommender 
exploits an innovative technology that helps the user, when
needed, to reformulate the query. Travel plans are stored in a memory
of cases, which is exploited for ranking travel items extracted from catalogues. 
A new ‘collaborative’ approach is introduced, where user past
behavior similarity is replaced with session (travel plan) similarity.
